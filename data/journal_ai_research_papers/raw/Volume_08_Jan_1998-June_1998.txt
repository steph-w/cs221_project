Abstract

Existing plan synthesis approaches in articial intelligence fall into two categories {
domain independent and domain dependent. The domain independent approaches are applicable across a variety of domains, but may not be very ecient in any one given domain.
The domain dependent approaches need to be (re)designed for each domain separately, but
can be very ecient in the domain for which they are designed. One enticing alternative
to these approaches is to automatically synthesize domain independent planners given the
knowledge about the domain and the theory of planning. In this paper, we investigate
the feasibility of using existing automated software synthesis tools to support such synthesis. Specically, we describe an architecture called CLAY in which the Kestrel Interactive
Development System (KIDS) is used to derive a domain-customized planner through a
semi-automatic combination of a declarative theory of planning, and the declarative control knowledge specic to a given domain, to semi-automatically combine them to derive
domain-customized planners. We discuss what it means to write a declarative theory of
planning and control knowledge for KIDS, and illustrate our approach by generating a class
of domain-specic planners using state space renements. Our experiments show that the
synthesized planners can outperform classical renement planners (implemented as instantiations of UCP, Kambhampati & Srivastava, 1995), using the same control knowledge. We
will contrast the costs and benets of the synthesis approach with conventional methods
for customizing domain independent planners.

1. Introduction

Given the current state of the world, a set of desired goals, and a set of action templates,
\planning" involves synthesizing a sequence of actions which when executed from the initial
state will lead to a state of the world that satises all the goals (Fikes & Nilsson, 1990;
McAllester & Rosenblitt, 1991; Kambhampati, 1997b). Planning is known to be a combinatorially hard problem, and a variety of approaches for plan synthesis have been developed
over the past twenty years. These approaches can be classied into two broad categories
{ domain independent and domain dependent. Domain independent planners do not make
any assumptions about the planning domains, and can thus accept and solve planning problems from any domain. In contrast, domain specic planners are specically designed for a
single domain and thus have the dynamics and control knowledge of the domain hard-coded.
The advantage of domain independent planning is that once a planning algorithm is
designed, it can be used in any domain by simply changing the action template that is
input to the algorithm. In contrast, domain-specic planners would have to be \modied"
or \re-designed" for each domain. On the ip-side, domain-specic planners tend to be more

ecient in their designated domains than domain independent planners since the latter may
not be able to eectively exploit the control knowledge of every domain.
Not surprisingly, a signicant amount of work in AI planning has been aimed at improving the performance of domain independent planners by dynamically customizing them to
a given domain. This customization is done by providing the domain writer the ability to
control the search of the planner, as is the case in task-reduction planning (Kambhampati
& Srivastava, 1996; Kambhamapti, 1995), or by using learning techniques (Kambhampati,
Katukam, & Qu, 1996; Minton, 1990). Although several approaches have been developed
for learning to improve planning performance, at present they are not an eective match
for the eciency of domain dependent planners.
One intriguing alternative is to automatically synthesize domain dependent planners
given the knowledge about the domain and the theory of planning. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using existing automated software synthesis tools to support such
a synthesis. We introduce the CLAY architecture which supports the synthesis of domain
dependent planners using KIDS, a semi-automated software synthesis system. Specically,
as shown in Figure 1, a declarative theory of plan synthesis (theory of planning) is combined
with the control knowledge specic to a given domain in a semi-automated software synthesis system called Kestrel Interactive Development System { KIDS (Smith, 1990, 1992a,
94

Synthesizing Customized Planners from Specifications

1992b) to derive a customized planner for the domain. We will draw the declarative theory
of plan synthesis from domain independent planning techniques. Domain specic control
knowledge will be expressed in terms of the types of plans that are preferred in the given
domain.
Such an approach strikes a promising middle-ground between domain independent and
domain dependent planners. The theories of planning are encoded independent of domains,
and the domain control knowledge can be encoded independent of the specic planning
theory being used. The customization step compiles the domain control knowledge into the
planning algorithm and ensures that the resulting planners are able to exploit the structure
of the domain.

1.1 Overview of the Synthesis Approach

As briey mentioned above, the practicality of our approach is predicated on the availability
of a software synthesis system capable of deriving code from formal specications. KIDS is
a powerful semi-automated system for development of correct and ecient programs from
formal specications. Given a domain theory and the input/output specication of a task,
KIDS system helps in synthesizing a program capable of solving the task. Here, the term
theory refers to any useful body of knowledge. Task refers to any assignment that is given
to KIDS for solving and the solution is a program for that task. The input to KIDS is a task
theory comprised of the task specication and a declarative description of useful concepts
and rules to reason in the task space. In this research, we give planning as a task to KIDS
and expect it to synthesize and return a planner as the solution. The planner can then take
planning problems as input and return results (plans).
In order to support planner synthesis, we have to develop and input a theory of planning
to KIDS. As discussed in (Kambhampati, 1997b), the traditional plan synthesis techniques
can be described in terms of a common plan representation, with dierent planners corresponding to dierent ways of rening the partial plans such as progression, regression and
plan-space renements (see Section 2.2). Consequently, our planning theory will consist of
a specication of the planning task (in terms of input and output data types) and one or
more renement theories. Since we are also interested in domain-customized planners, we
have to provide the necessary domain knowledge to KIDS.
Given these inputs, KIDS semi-automatically synthesizes a program (in this case, a domain dependent renement planner) using generic algorithm design tactics (such as branch
and bound, global search). The resulting planner, like conventional planners, can handle
any planning problem from the domain. See Section 3 for more details.

1.2 Outcomes

To understand the ecacy of plan synthesis in CLAY, in this paper, we concentrate on the
synthesis of planners using state-space renement theories.1 Empirical evaluation shows
that these synthesized planners can be very ecient. For example, in the blocks world
domain where the goal was stack inversion, a KIDS synthesized planner solved a 14 blocks
problem in under a minute. In the logistics domain, a problem with 12 packages, 4 planes
1. In future, we plan to extend our approach to plan-space and task-reduction renements.

95

Srivastava & Kambhampati

and 8 places was solved in under a minute. Similarly, in the Tyre domain (Russell & Norvig,
1995), the \xit" problem was solved in under a minute. To put these performance results
in perspective, we compared KIDS' synthesized planners to a set of classical planners implemented as the instantiations the UCP planning system (Kambhampati & Srivastava,
1995). As described later, instantiations of UCP can emulate a spectrum of classical planners, including the popular SNLP planner (McAllester & Rosenblitt, 1991), by selecting
the appropriate renement. In our experiments, the best of the KIDS' synthesized planners
outperformed the best of the UCP instantiations when given the same domain-specic information. We hypothesize that this is because KIDS can protably fold-in the domain-specic
control knowledge (i.e., the domain theory) into the planning code.

1.3 Organization

The rest of this paper describes the details of our approach, called the CLAY architecture
for planner synthesis. The paper is organized as follows: after a brief review of traditional
plan synthesis approaches and software synthesis on KIDS in Section 2, we walk through
the CLAY framework in Section 3. Section 4 presents a discussion on the nature of planners
synthesized by our approach. Section 5 empirically evaluates the synthesized planners and
compares them to classical planners. Section 6 discusses related work. Section 7 describes
our conclusions and discusses the costs and benets of the synthesis approach.

2. Background

In this section, we briey discuss relevant background on software synthesis with KIDS,
and plan generation that will be needed to follow the rest of the paper.

2.1 Kestrel Interactive Development System

Before discussing KIDS, we start with some preliminaries on automated software synthesis.
The holy grail of software synthesis is to :
 Produce highly reliable, adaptable software in a greatly reduced development time.
 Automate detail intensive tasks in software production that are largely non-creative
in nature.
A program, or program segment, P , is correct with respect to an initial condition (assertion) I and a nal condition (assertion) F if and only if whenever I is true prior to the execution of P , and P terminates, F will be true after the execution of P is complete. Using a
formal specication of the task, a knowledge-base and an inference system, knowledge-based
software synthesis proceeds with an iterative specication renement process to specialize
the general knowledge of program development (in the form of algorithm theories) to solve
specic tasks on hand. The renements are sound in that if the specication is correct, the
synthesized program (code) will be correct.
KIDS is a program-transformation framework for the development of programs from
formal specications of a task. KIDS runs on Sun workstations and is built over REFINE,
a commercial knowledge-based programming environment and a high-level language. The

REFINE language supports rst-order logic, set-theory, pattern matching and transformation rules. Rene provides a compiler that generates Common Lisp or C code for programs
written in its logical specication language.
In the following, we describe the general steps involved in synthesizing software on KIDS.
Figure 2 provides an overview of this process. The process is illustrated in more detail in
Section 3 in the context of synthesis of customized planner code.
1. Develop a task theory to state and reason about the task. The user denes appropriate
functions and types that describe the task and also gives laws that allow high-level
reasoning about the dened functions. For planning, many planning theories (e.g.,
progression and regression) were written and relevant laws were specied. We also provided domain theories so that KIDS could perform specialized reasoning on planners
it returned as solutions.
2. Select and apply a design tactic to select an algorithmic framework that should be
used to implement the task specication. KIDS currently supports a variety of design tactics including problem reduction, divide and conquer, global search and local
search. For planning, we use the global search design tactic because our formalization
97

Srivastava & Kambhampati

of classical planning is driven by renement search which can be seen as a special case
of global search (see below).
3. Apply optimizations to make the generated algorithm ecient. At rst, the generated
algorithm is well-structured and correct in that it can return all valid solutions, but
it can be very inecient. The algorithm is optimized through specication reduction
techniques such as simplication, partial evaluation and nite-dierencing.
4. Compile the algorithm to produce a program in the base language.
The domain theories and specications are written in REFINE, and KIDS synthesizes
and optimizes the algorithms in the same language. To transform specications into programs as well as to optimize the programs, KIDS uses a form of deductive reasoning called
\directed inference" to reason about the task specication and domain theory.
The KIDS system has been used to derive a variety of programs in the past. Of particular
interest to us is the work on deriving ecient scheduling software (Smith & Parra, 1993;
Burstein & Smith, 1996), as the success of these programs provided initial impetus for our
own research.

2.2 Theories of Plan Synthesis

As mentioned earlier, using KIDS to derive planning software in CLAY involves guring
out (a) how declarative theories for dierent types of classical planning are specied and
(b) what algorithmic design templates are best suited to planner synthesis. (Kambhampati,
1997b) provides an overview of traditional plan synthesis approaches. As discussed there,
plan synthesis approaches come in many varieties with very little supercial commonality
between them. In the last few years, we have developed a unifying framework that subsumes
most of these approaches (Kambhampati & Srivastava, 1995; Kambhampati, Knoblock, &
Yang, 1995; Kambhampati, 1997b). In this framework, plan synthesis is modeled as a
process of searching in a space of sets of action sequences. These sets are represented
compactly as collections of constraints called \partial plans." The search process rst
attempts to extract a result (an action sequence capable of solving the problem) from the
partial plan, and when that fails, \renes" (or splits) the partial plan into a set of new partial
plans (each corresponding to sets of action sequences that are subsets of the action sequence
set corresponding to the original partial plan), and considers the new plans in turn. The
existing domain independent plan-synthesis algorithms correspond to four dierent ways of
rening partial plans. These are known, respectively, as Forward State Space or progression
renement (FSS), Backward State Space Renement or regression renement (BSS), Plan
Space Renement (PSS) and Task-Reduction Renement. STRIPS (Fikes & Nilsson, 1990)
is an example of a planner using the FSS renement, TOPI (Barrett & Weld, 1994) uses
the BSS renement, SNLP (McAllester & Rosenblitt, 1991) uses the plan-space renement
and NONLIN (Tate, 1977) uses the task-reduction renement. Given this background, the
declarative theory of plan generation in CLAY corresponds to theories of the renements.
The algorithm tactic underlying plan generation corresponds to \renement search." The
KIDS system supports an algorithm tactic called \global search" (Smith, 1992a) which can
be seen as a generalization of this renement search.

3. Developing a Planner from Declarative Specication: The CLAY
Architecture

Figure 1 summarizes how KIDS is used to synthesize a domain-specic renement planner. The domain knowledge consists of a dynamical model and control knowledge. The
dynamical model is specied in the form of actions (also called operators) that dene legal transformations from one state of the world to another. Control knowledge is a set of
domain-specic criteria that helps the planner decide if a plan P1 is better than P2 and is
intended to make search more ecient. An example of control knowledge is that in a logistics domain where some packages have to be moved to their destinations using airplanes,
planes should not touchdown at a location if they have no packages to pickup or deliver.
Renement planning and domain control knowledge are brought together in the CLAY
architecture for writing declarative domain-specic planning theory as summarized in Figure 3. To specify a planning task, a plan representation is selected and the constraints
that should be satised by a solution plan are enumerated in the planner specication.
The planner specication is dependent on the plan representation but is independent of
the renement needed for search. A renement strategy uses the planner specication and
denes how children nodes are generated from a given partial plan, what the goal test will
be, and also explicates any renement specic search pruning tests. The renement and the
99

Srivastava & Kambhampati

specication together form the planning theory. To obtain a domain dependent planner, all
one needs to do is import any planning theory and provide some relevant domain-specic
planning control knowledge that provides a preference structure among partial plans and
competing solutions. An interesting special case is when one species a generic domain
knowledge to the eect that all the plans are equally good in the domain. In such a case,
based on the renement used, one gets a FSS, BSS, PSS or hybrid (if multiple renements
are used), general-purpose planner.
Each level in the directed tree in Figure 3 represents an abstraction of the planning
task. At the root of the tree (Level 1), only a description of a planning task is required
without specifying what renements strategies should be used. At Level 2, the renements
are specied but no assumption is made about the domain. Next, characteristics of the
domain are provided at Level 3. A progression (FSS) blocks world planner is dierent from
a progression logistics domain planner only in terms of the domain knowledge. On the other
hand, a progression blocks world planner is dierent from a regression (BSS) blocks-world
planner only in terms of the renement used.
As stated above, to ensure exibility, the control knowledge should not change when
dierent renements are used and thereby represent substantial exibility. But in practice,
since control knowledge helps prune children nodes produced by a renement, pruning may
be more eective if the control knowledge is encoded depending on the renement. There
can also be a middle ground that we have not implemented: domain control knowledge
may be represented in an intermediate form depending on the partial plan representation.
Each renement can provide, in addition to a termination test, a conversion function to
transform the control knowledge into the renement specic form.

3.1 Representing Domain Operators

We now discuss how the world state is represented and how the domain operators dene
state transformations. In classical planning, the world is modeled in terms of a set of \state
variables." Each state of the world corresponds to a particular assignments of values to these
variables. The actions are described in terms of the specic variable-value combinations that
are needed for them to be applicable, and the variable-value combinations they will enforce
after execution. Two variants of this general modeling approach have become popular in the
planning community. The rst, called the STRIPS representation (Fikes & Nilsson, 1990)
represents the world in terms of ground atoms in a rst order logic. The action applicability
conditions and eects are also described in terms of conjunctions of ground atoms. The
second variant (Backstrom & Nebel, 1993) models the world and actions directly in terms
of multi-valued state variables and their values. Since STRIPS representation can be seen
as a state-variable model with boolean state-variables, and since any multi-valued statevariable system can be converted into an equivalent boolean state-variable system, the two
representations are equivalent in expressive power.
We chose the state-variable representation for our implementation since this can be
directly mapped on to the primitive data structures supported by KIDS. Figure 4 shows
the action of moving block A from block B to the top of block C in STRIPS and statevariable representation. A blocks world domain is an environment in which some blocks
are placed on a table or on top of other blocks and the problems involve stacking them in

variables corresponding to block positions (e.g., pos-A) by symbols 'B', 'C', etc. and clear
conditions (e.g., clr-A) by True or False. In practice, we map all the valid values of state
variables to integers.

3.2 Specication of a Planner

KIDS uses a functional specication and programming language augmented with set-theoretic
data types. A specication of the task (Smith, 1992a) is represented by a quadruple
F = hD; R; I; Oi where D is the input type satisfying the input condition, I : D ! boolean.
The output type is R and the output condition, O : D  R ! boolean, denes a feasible solution. If O(x,z) holds, then z is a feasible solution with respect to input x. The specication
of a program follows the template:
function F (x :D) : set(R)
where I(x)
returns f z j O (x,z) g
= Body(x)
A specication for program F is consistent if for all possible inputs satisfying the input
condition, the body produces a feasible solution, i.e., 8(x : D)9(z : R)(I (x) =) O(x; z )).
Within this view, a planner takes as inputs an initial state, a goal state and an operator
list. The operators are assumed to dene state transitions from valid states to valid states.
A specication for the planning task is: given the initial state, the goal state and the
operator list, return a sequence of operators (plan) such that:



termination-test: The goals must hold in the nal state resulting from the execu-

tion of the plan. (We are only considering planning problems in which the goal is to
make all state-variables achieve specied values, i.e., goals of achievement).
 domain-independent-pruning-test: The plan passes the domain independent
pruning tests. Each planning renemen can specify conditions under which a partialplan cannot lead to a desirable solution; and any partial plan satisfying such a pruning
101

Srivastava & Kambhampati

function PLANNER
(INIT: seq(integer), GOAL: seq(integer),
OPERS: seq(tuple(seq(integer), seq(integer))))
returns
(PLAN: seq(integer)

& GOODNESS-TEST(VISITED-STATES

& NO-MOVES-BACK(VISITED-STATES
(PLAN, INIT, GOAL, OPERS),
INIT, GOAL)
& GOAL-TEST(VISITED-STATES
(PLAN, INIT, GOAL, OPERS),
INIT, GOAL))

Figure 5: A declarative specication for planning
test can be eliminated from further consideration. For example, the state-loop pruning heuristic in forward state-space renement says that if we have a partial plan such
that the plan-state after executing operator O2 is a subset of the state following an
earlier operator O1 , then such a partial-plan can be pruned.
 domain-dependent-pruning-test: The plan passes the additional domain-specic
pruning tests.
The last one is the hook through which domain specic control knowledge is introduced.
In the current implementation of CLAY, we use domain knowledge for rejecting undesirable
partial plans. In Section 7.1, we discuss ways in which our implementation can be extended
to support other uses of domain control knowledge.
The specication of the planning task above is declarative in that it states what constraints must be satised in the resulting plan produced by a planner when given a planning
problem. It does not suggest any algorithm that should be used to obtain the results. Algorithmic decisions will be made in the program development phase of KIDS.
An example of top-level specication of planning task (in REFINE) is shown in Figure 5.
In this specication, the input condition, I , is true, the input data type, D includes INIT,
GOAL and OPERS, the output data type R is PLAN and the output condition O consists of
goodness-test, goal-test, no-moves-back. no-moves-back is a domain independent
pruning tests whereas goodness-test is a domain dependent pruning test.
Delving deeper into representation detail, we represent a plan as a sequence of indices
in the operator list (i.e., sequence of operator identiers). For state-space planning, the
state sequence corresponding to the partial-plan is produced by function visited-states
and the goal test, domain independent pruning tests and domain dependent pruning tests
are done on the state-sequence by functions goal-test, no-moves-back and goodnesstest respectively. The state-variables take integer values. Consequently, our initial and
goal states are a sequence of integers.
In words, the specication in Figure 5 says that a partial plan is a sequence of integral
indices (of operators) and so the indices must not be more than the size of operator list. Valid
102

Synthesizing Customized Planners from Specifications

plan is one whose corresponding state sequence (produced by visited-states) satises the
goal-test, no-moves-back and goodness-test2.
In the context of forward-state space renement (FSS), visited-states returns the
states obtained by the successive application of the operators in the partial plan to the
initial state and the resulting states thereafter. goal-test signals that the goal has been
achieved; for FSS renement it involves checking that the last state in the state-sequence
is the goal state. The no-moves-back function tests state looping; forward state-space
looping checks if the state after executing operator Oj (STATE Sj ) is a subset of the state
following an earlier operator Oi (i < j ) (STATE Si ), this partial-plan can be pruned3.
The function goodness-test checks for possible redundancy in the state sequence
corresponding to the current partial plan based on domain characteristics. Let us explain
it in the context of the blocks world domain. We can specify any reasonable checks for the
blocks world as long as they do not make the planner lose a desired solution. Below, we
present two goodness-tests:

 (Heuristic H1: Limit useless moves) If a block moves between states i and (i+1), it

must not change position between states (i+1) and (i+2). The motivation behind this
check is to prevent blocks from being moved around randomly in successive moves.
 (Heuristic H2: Move via table) A block can only move from its initial state to the
table and from table only to its goal position. This is motivated by the fact that
a polynomial time approximate algorithm for solving blocks world planning problems involves putting all blocks on table rst, and then constructing each of the goal
conguration stacks bottom-up.4

3.3 Implementing the Specication using Global Search

As discussed in Section 2, we need to select an algorithm design tactic to implement the task
specication in KIDS. One of the design tactics provided by KIDS is global search. The basic
idea of global search is to represent and manipulate sets of candidate solutions. The principal
operations are to extract candidate solutions from a set and to split a set into subsets.
Derived operations include various lters which are used to eliminate sets containing no
feasible or optimal solutions. Global search algorithms work as follows: starting from an
initial set of potential solutions, that contains all desired solutions to the given problem
instance, the algorithm repeatedly extracts solutions, splits sets and eliminates sets via
lters until a candidate solution can be drawn from one of the sets. Sets of solutions are
represented implicitly by data structures called descriptors, and splitting is done by adding
2. REFINE code of all the referenced functions is shown in Appendix A.
3. Actually, we test a slightly more general condition that if the state after executing operator Oj (STATE
Sj ) is weaker than a state following an earlier operator Oi (STATE Si ), then this partial-plan can be
pruned. Sj is weaker than Si if every state-variable with assigned value in state Si has that same assigned
value in state Sj . By specifying weakness rather than subset as the relationship between states to decide
domain independent pruning in state space planning, we allow the synthesized planner to deal with a
partially specied initial state. The planner will work correctly as long as all the state-variables that are
required for reasoning are specied in the initial state.
4. Our pruning test alone doesn't guarantee polynomial algorithm since the order in which the blocks are
to be put on the table or later at the goal positions is not specied in the pruning heuristic.

103

Srivastava & Kambhampati

mutually exclusive and exhaustive sets of constraints to the descriptors. The process can
be described as a tree search in which a node represents a set of candidates and an arc
represents the split relationship between a set and its subset. For complete details, readers
are referred to (Smith, 1992a).
The KIDS' global search paradigm is a general form of the renement search model
used to unify classical planners in UCP (Kambhampati & Srivastava, 1995). Specically,
the partial plans correspond to descriptors and the renements correspond to splitting
strategies. To use global search to implement the planner specication, we need to select
a suitable representation for sets of potential solutions (which, in the renement view of
planning, are essentially the partial plans). The global search tactic would then set up a
search algorithm that can split a solution-set and extract solutions that meet the problem
specication. KIDS provides global search tactics for primitive data-types such as sequences,
sets and maps. If a complex data type is needed to represent the potential solution set of
a task, the user must implement a global search tactic for it.
Since we are interested in state-space planners initially, we chose to represent the partial
plan as a sequence of operators (actually sequence of operator indices). This allowed us to
use KIDS global search theory for nite sequences.

3.4 Specifying Distributive and Monotonic laws

One aspect of KIDS specication that is slightly unintuitive to new users is the need to
specify distributive and monotonic laws on all the operations used in the input/output
specication (e.g., no-moves-back in the specication of the progression planner shown in
Figure 5). Distributive laws state how a specic operation distributes over other operations
(e.g., (A + B )  C  (A  C ) + (B  C )), while monotonic laws provide a set of boundary
conditions (e.g., A +0 = A). Such laws should be explicitly stated for all operations involved
in the specication to support instantiation of design tactics, as well as optimization of
generated code. Specically, KIDS has a directed-inference engine called RAINBOW which
uses the task specication and the distributed laws specied by the user to simplify and
reformulate the expressions in the synthesized code. Deductive inference is the primary
means by which KIDS reasons about the task specication in order to apply design tactics,
and optimize the code, and derive necessary pruning conditions. Distributive and monotonic
laws indirectly provide KIDS with information on alternative ways of dening predicates.
A useful heuristic in writing laws is that they should be simple, normally expressed in
terms of the main function and perhaps another function to handle boundary cases (called
cross-functions; see below). As an example, consider Figure 5 where function no-movesback is a domain independent pruning test used in the specication of progression planners.
Recall that no-moves-back is called on a state sequence and checks that a later state is
not a subset of (or weaker than) an earlier state. Calling no-moves-back on a sequence S
which is a concatenation of state sequences S1 and S2 is equivalent to calling it on S1 and
S2 and testing that no state in S1 is weaker than a state in S2. Notice that the rst two
tests can be handled by no-moves-back itself but the last test needs a new function. We
call this new function a cross-function for no-moves-back (cross-no-moves-back). The
monotonic laws for no-moves-back include:



no-moves-back over a singleton state sequence is true.

104

Synthesizing Customized Planners from Specifications



no-moves-back over an empty state sequence is false (useful when the selected action

is not applicable).

Similarly, the distributive laws for no-moves-back include:



no-moves-back over sequence concatenation is equal to no-moves-back on S1 , nomoves-back on S2 and cross-no-moves-back on S1 and S2 .

 When a state A is prepended to a state sequence S , applying no-moves-back over

such a combined state sequence is equivalent to applying cross-no-moves-back on
the singleton sequence [A] and S , and no-moves-back on S .
 When a state A is appended to a state sequence S , no-moves-back over such a
combined state sequence is the same as no-moves-back on S and cross-no-movesback on S and the singleton sequence [A].

All these rules, while reasonably obvious to us, are nonetheless very crucial for the
eectiveness of KIDS as they help it in reformulating and optimizing the generated code.
An example of their use, as we will see in Section 3.5.1, occurs in Figure 7 where an \if
[condition] - [then] - [else]" statement gets simplied to just the \[then]" part because all
the conditions in the \[condition]" can be proved to be true in the context of the input
specication, given the distributive laws.
Using the task specication, the selected design tactic { global search, and distributive
laws, KIDS produces a correct but naive code, as shown in Figure 6. The code is naive
because the same checks (for example cross-no-moves-back in Figure 6) are computed
repeatedly even if they are true from their context. We discuss some methods to optimize
the code in the next section.

3.5 Program Optimization

This section explains how the initial planner code, generated by KIDS, is optimized. Readers
not familiar with automated software synthesis literature might want to skip this section
on rst read, and revisit it later for more details.
The rst code produced by KIDS (shown in Figure 6) is well-structured but very inecient. There are several opportunities for optimization and KIDS provides tools for program
optimization. The code can be compiled and executed at any stage of optimization. Now,
we briey summarize the program optimizations used to achieve eciency.
3.5.1 Context Independent Simplifier

This method simplies an expression independent of its surrounding context. There are
two possibilities for context independent simplication:
 In the rst case, a set of equations are treated as left-to-right rewrite rules that are
red exhaustively until none apply. Distributive laws are also treated as rewrite rules.
An example application of a rewrite rule is:
(if true then P else Q) =) P

3.5.2 Context Dependent Simplifier

This method is designed to simplify a given expression with respect to its surrounding context and is, thus, more powerful than context independent simplication. All the predicates
that hold in the context of the expression are gathered by walking up the abstract syntax
tree. The expression is then simplied with respect to the set of assumptions that hold in
the context. In Figure 8, the function calls for no-moves-back, goodness-test and the
range test in the \if" expression are redundant because their results follow from the input
invariant (conditions listed after \j" and before \:") of the PLANNER-AUX function. So
they are removed by this simplication.

3.5.3 Finite Differencing

The idea behind nite dierencing is to perform computations incrementally rather than
repeat them from scratch every time. Let us assume that inside a function f (x) there is
an expression g(x) and that x changes in a regular way. In this case, it might be useful to
create a new variable, equal to g(x), whose value is maintained across iterations and which
allows for incremental computation of g(x) with the next x value. Finite dierencing can be
decomposed into two more basic operations: abstraction and simplication (Smith, 1992a)

 First, the function f is abstracted with respect to expression g(x) adding a new
parameter c to parameter list of f (now f (x; c)) and adding c = g(x) as a new input
invariant to f . All calls to f , whether recursive calls within f or external calls, must
now be changed to match the denition of f i.e, f (x) is changed to f (x; g(x)). In this
process, all occurrences of g(x) are replaced by c.
 If distributive laws apply to g(h(x)) yielding an expression of the form h0(g(x)) and
so h0 (c), the new value of g(h(x)) can be computed in terms of the old value of g(x)
and this the real benet in optimization.

Let us illustrate this process with an example. Suppose that some function f (x) has a
call for function g(x) which returns the square of numbers and that variable x varies linearly.
Now, suppose that we are given a distributive law such as g(x + 1) = g(x) + 2  x + 1. So,
after nite-dierencing, f becomes f (x; c) and the g(x) call is replaced by c + 2  x + 1.
109

Srivastava & Kambhampati

An additional invariant c = x  x will also be maintained for f . This new expression is
computationally much cheaper than the original expression.
In Figure 9, nite dierencing is performed on size(OPERS ). The argument of function
PLANNER is expanded with the inclusion of NUM-OPS, the name entered by the user for
the value of size(OPERS ). Only abstraction is done here as the number of operators
available to the planner does not change during planning. Note that NUM-OPS represents
the number of operators in a planning problem and this is a meaningful concept for planning.
All instances of size(OPERS ) are replaced by NUM-OPS.
3.5.4 Program Derivation

Figure 10 shows a summary of the sequence of derivation steps carried out to obtain a
blocks world domain-specic forward-state space planner. The nal version of the planner
code is shown in Figure 11.
In step 0, the top-level planner specication is selected and in step 1, selected design
tactic is applied. Step 2 involves a context independent simplication, and steps 3 and
4 involve context dependent simplications. Steps 5 through 8 cover nite dierencing.
Finally, an ecient planner code is compiled in step 10.

4. Discussion on Synthesized Planners

Section 3.5 used the synthesis of a progression planner for blocks world domain as a case
study to walk-through the planner synthesis process leading to the nal planner given
in Figure 11. In our research, we have also considered regression (backward state space)
planners. All the planners we have synthesized to date are summarized in Table 1. Although
each of these planners dier in terms of the renements they use, and the domains to which
they are customized, Figure 12 attempts a pseudo-code description of a generic template to
facilitate discussion of the synthesized planners as a group.
The main function planner takes initial state, goal state and operator set as
inputs and in turn calls the recursive function planner aux with all the inputs and an
initial plan. All the pruning tests comprising the output conditions are maintained as
\invariants" (in that they must hold not only of the nal plan, but also of the every partial
plan leading to the nal plan). The goal test, of course, need only hold for the nal plan,
and is thus not maintained as an invariant. Finite dierencing leads to more invariants.
Inside planner aux, if a partial plan satises the goal test, it is returned. Otherwise,
the partial plan is rened, invariants are incrementally tested in the new partial plan and
planner aux is called recursively.
First thing we note is that the pseudo-code template describes a planner for any planning
domain employing any state-space renement. Even the requirement that the synthesized
planner be state-space is dictated by how the new partial plan (partial-plan2) is obtained
(in this case by appending an operator to an operator sequence). It can be generalized to
support other renements, by modifying the operation (in the current case \append") that
is used to build the new partial plan from the old one (with corresponding changes to the
distributive laws to account for the new operation).
Second, we observe that all invariants are incrementally evaluated (see planner aux).
For example, to see if the the plan in ith iteration satises the no-moves-back test, we only
110

Synthesizing Customized Planners from Specifications

check if the latest state is duplicated by any of the previous states. We hypothesize that such
incremental evaluation is the primary reason for the synthesized planner's eciency. Once
renement and planning domain knowledge is available, context-dependent simplication
may show that many of the tests made in the separate theories are in fact redundant.
Moreover, incremental evaluations may be cheaper than complete evaluations of invariants
if they are amenable to the operations of distribution and monotonicity over the abstract
data-types.
Although domain independent planners can be given the same control knowledge that
we give to KIDS during planner synthesis, our approach is expected to be superior in two
ways:
1. Our approach separates the control knowledge acquisition from the specics of the
planner to some extent and this makes the acquisition process easier. In contrast,
controlling the search of a domain independent planner requires the user to think in
terms of specic \choice-points" in the planner's search strategy.
2. More importantly, search control in domain independent planners typically involves
generating unpromising partial plans rst and then pruning them. In contrast, our approach improves eciency by \folding in" the control knowledge into the synthesized
planner code, through incremental evaluation of pruning test. Specically, to a rst
approximation, conventional domain independent planners will add the goodnesstest either to control their search at the choice points or to post-process the generated partial plans. We specify distributive laws on how the goodness-test can be
incrementally evaluated (in terms of cross-goodness-test and goodness-test)
and perform context-dependent analysis on all the pieces of available knowledge to
optimize the code. This is what we mean by \folding in" the control knowledge.
In Figure 11, we can see an instance of control knowledge being folded into the synthesized progression planner for the blocks world domain. Contrast it to the rst synthesized
planner shown in Figure 6. We notice that redundant invocation of various checks (such
as goodness-test, visited-states, etc) in the earlier planner have been simplied away.
Moreover, individual checks (such as no-moves-back and goodness-test) have been
further simplied based on the distributive laws (like cross-no-moves-back and crossgoodness-test) to consider just the newly added parts of the partial plan. All these
considerations lead to a very small and ecient nal planner.

5. Empirical Evaluation of Synthesized Planners

Table 1 lists several domain dependent state-space planners that we have synthesized to
date. The planners are characterized by the domain for which they are developed (\BW" for
blocks world, \LOG" for logistics, and \TYR" for Tyre World { all of which are benchmark
domains in AI planning); the type of (state-space) renement used (\P" for progression
and \R" for regression), and the type of domain specic control knowledge used (H1 that
limits useless moves, H2 which moves blocks via table, etc.). We will now report results of
an empirical study conducted over these synthesized planners. The study had two aims:
 To ascertain whether the synthesized planners are able to eciently exploit domain
knowledge.

 To ascertain if the synthesized planners are better than traditional domain indepen-

dent planners in utilizing domain control knowledge.
Our discussion is organized as follows: In Section 5.1, we describe the domains and
problems we have considered in our empirical work. In Section 5.2, we evaluate the absolute
performance of the synthesized planners in the various domains. In Section 5.3 we compare
the performance of synthesized planners and traditional planners.

5.1 Domains and Problems
5.1.1 Blocks World Domain

A blocks world domain is an environment in which each block is placed either on a table or on
top of other blocks, and the problems involve stacking them in some desired conguration.
Let us focus on two states in particular: A-ON-TOP and N-ON-TOP. When there are A
.. N blocks, A-ON-TOP stands for the state where block A is on top of block B, block B

is on top of block C, ..., block N-1 is on top of block N and block N is on table. Similarly,
N-ON-TOP stands for the state in which block A is on table, block B is on top of block A,
..., block N is on top of block N-1. Problems for the reported experiments are one of three
types:
1. Stack Inversion: Invert from A-ON-TOP to N-ON-TOP.
2. Stack building: Initial state is a collection of random stacks of up to two blocks height
in which the last N/2 blocks are either put on the rst N/2 blocks or on the table.
Goal state is A-ON-TOP or N-ON-TOP.
3. Random blocks world problems: A subset of random blocks world problems generated using Minton's algorithm (Minton, 1988). In a problem with N blocks, the goal
state can have up to N/2 goal conditions.
Some domain dependent pruning tests for blocks world were covered in Section 3. Specically, we covered pruning test H1 that prevents any block from being moved in consecutive
steps, and test H2 which requires that all blocks have to be moved via the table.
5.1.2 Logistics Domain

The logistics domain consists of a several planes and packages at dierent places. The goals
involve transporting the planes and packages to the specied locations. We considered a
type of logistics domain where there are k planes, 2k places and 3k packages. There can be
either 2 packages or 1 package and 1 plane at each place. The goal is to get all planes and
packages to a distinguished place.
The domain dependent pruning test for the logistics transportation domain, (which we
call \Limit Ineciency" heuristic) consists of the following pieces of advice:
113

Srivastava & Kambhampati

1. Planes should not make consecutive ights without loading or unloading a package
2. Packages should either be at the goal position to begin with, or may be loaded inside
a plane and then own to their goal position.
3. Once a package reaches its goal position, it should not be moved.
5.1.3 Tyre World Domain

The Tyre world (Russell & Norvig, 1995) is a benchmark domain with complex causal
structure (Blum & Furst, 1995). In the \xit" problem from this domain, a car's tyre is
at and must be replaced by a spare at tyre (which must rst be inated). The original
tyre has to be placed in the boot and all tools must be returned to the boot. The domain
dependent pruning test that we devised enforces the following constraints:
1. If only one state variable changes between one state(S1 ) and the next state(S2 ), it
should not change in the subsequent state(S3 ). This is because a state variable describes an attribute about an object in the domain. If the attribute has a value in
state S2 that will be \overwritten" in state S3 , this might indicate a non-minimal
plan.5
2. Work on the status of boot last.
3. Fixing up a free hub is invalid { a wheel must be on it rst.
4. If we have jacked-up the car that needs a tyre, we can not jack it down without putting
the tyre on it.
5. Work on the position of the pump and wrench after all the wheels and the hub are in
their nal conguration.
6. Once the wheels are in their goal positions, they should not be moved.

5.2 Absolute Performance of the Synthesized Planners

In this section, we discuss the absolute performance of the synthesized planners in dierent
domains. As we shall see, the synthesized planners were able to solve the benchmark
problems that are known to be hard for the traditional planners. A special note is in order
regarding the plots that follow. In all the plots that follow, if a curve stops mid-way in a
graph, it means that the corresponding planner could not solve the given problem or all
problems in the problem class (as applicable) in the stipulated time.
5.2.1 Planners in Blocks World

In traditional planners, domain specic information helps the planner return a result faster
and we obtained similar results with the synthesized planners. As can be seen from the left
5. This is not true in all domains, since in some domains, the only way a state variable can shift its value
from v1 to v3 is to transition through v2 . The heuristic however does preserve completeness in the tyre
world.

plot in Figure 13, the domain-specic blocks world heuristic H1 (\Limit useless moves")
helped the progression planner (BW-P-H1) solve the stack inversion problem (invert AON-TOP to N-ON-TOP) for 14 blocks in under a minute, and for 22 blocks in under 30
minutes. Without such a heuristic, the progression planner (INDEP-P) could not solve even
a 5 block stack inversion problem in the same time.
5.2.2 Planners in the Logistics Domain

In the logistics domain, the progression planner with the Limit Ineciency heuristic (LOGP-L) could solve 4-plane problems in under a minute and 6-plane problems in 30 minutes
(Figure 13, right). Without such a heuristic, the progression planner (INDEP-P) could not
solve even the 2 plane problem in the same time.
5.2.3 Planners in the Tyre World

There are 25 operators, 27 state variables and 6 control rules in our manually encoded Tyre
world (Russell & Norvig, 1995) description. The xit problem was solved in under a minute
and a 31 step plan was returned.

5.3 Comparing Traditional and Synthesized Planners in Blocks World

Since our synthesized planners used domain specic control knowledge that is not normally
used by domain independent planners, our next step involved comparing synthesized planners to domain independent planners using the same control knowledge. Our aim is to see
if the synthesized planners are better able to exploit the domain knowledge than the traditional planners. We restricted this detailed comparison to the blocks world domain. Since
115

Srivastava & Kambhampati

there are a variety of traditional classical planners each of which have varying tradeos
(c.f. (Barrett & Weld, 1994; Kambhampati et al., 1995)), we used a \league tournament"
approach in our comparison. Specically, since most popular classical planners correspond
to dierent instantiations of UCP (Kambhampati & Srivastava, 1995), we rst ran them all
on our blocks world problem distribution to isolate the best traditional planners. Similar
study was done to isolate the best synthesized planners for our problem distribution. At
this point, the best synthesized planner is compared to the best traditional planner. In
this second round of comparison, the winning traditional planner is given the same control
knowledge as the synthesized planner.
We have used two of the three blocks world test suites { the random blocks world
problems and the stack building problems { in the comparisons. Each problem class is
dened in terms of the number of blocks and an average of 10 runs is shown in each plot.
The total time allowed for a class of problems was 1000 seconds after which the planner was
deemed to have failed on that problem class. All planners were run on the same problems
from the problem suite.
5.3.1 Picking the Best Synthesized Planner

In this section, we want to empirically determine the the most eective renement and
control knowledge (heuristics) for the blocks world problem suites. We ran six synthesized
planners (BW-P-H1, BW-P-H2, INDEP-P, BW-R-H1, BW-R-H2 and INDEP-R) on the
above test suite. Figure 14 shows the relative performance. We notice that planners with
the pruning test H2 perform the best when compared with other planners using the same
renement.6
5.3.2 Picking the Best Traditional Planner

In this section, we empirically search for the best UCP strategy in the blocks world. Figure 15 shows the performance of UCP instantiations with no domain dependent heuristic
information. Instantiations of UCP which do only FSS, BSS or PS renements can emulate
classical forward-state space, backward-state space or plan-space planners, respectively. We
call these instantiations UCP-FSS, UCP-BSS and UCP-PS. UCP-LCFR is a hybrid strategy
which interleaves FSS, BSS and PS renements depending on the lower branching factor
(Kambhampati & Srivastava, 1995). In both the random blocks world problems (left) and
the stacking building problems (right), the left and right plots, UCP-FSS solves all of the
6. We also notice that progression planners perform better in the left plot and regression planners perform
better in the right plot. This trend can be explained easily in terms of the way the renements operate
(Kambhampati, 1997b). In the left gure, based on the nature of the goals, the branching factor for
the regression planners may become enormous because it cannot detect all the conicts among the
steps that give conditions at the goal (or at steps which eventually support the goal condition). Many
more operators seem to potentially give a condition than is actually the case. On the other hand, the
completely specied initial state helps the progression planner decide all applicable operators from the
beginning itself. Consequently, progression planner BW-P-H2 is a clear win. In the right plot, as the
initial and goal states are completely specied, both regression and progression planners can detect all
conicts. As is true in realistic domains, many more operators are applicable from the initial state than
are relevant to achieving the goal conditions. So, the regression planner BW-R-H2 performs better than
the progression planner BW-P-H2.

for the blocks world problem distributions we used.7
5.3.3 Comparing the Best Synthesized Planner and Best Traditional
Planner

Finally, we pit the best UCP strategy for the blocks world, namely UCP-FSS, against
the best of KIDS' synthesized planners. We chose BW-P-H2 for the random blocks world
problem suite and BW-R-H2 for the stack building problem suite. Comparison is done when
all planners are either given the same heuristic information (H2) or no domain dependent
guidance. Figure 16 plots the results. In the left plot, BW-P-H2 is a clear winner when
both planners are given the domain specic heuristic H2. In the right plot, BW-R-H2
outperforms UCP-FSS with H2. So, we see that given the same heuristic information, the
best of the planners synthesized by KIDS can outperform the best instantiation of UCP for
the blocks world.
It is interesting to note that while all synthesized planners improve drastically with
domain specic knowledge, domain independent planners do not always improve in the
same way. We illustrate this in Figure 17, where we compare UCP instantiations and the
synthesized planers with and without control heuristics. While the synthesized planners

progression in the stack building problems. In contrast, UCP-FSS out performs UCP-BSS for the same
problem suite. The reason for this had to do with the particular implementation of UCP-BSS, which
involves a costly unication step.

instantiations. Specically, in the right plot, we see that UCP-FSS-H2, which uses control
knowledge H2 does worse than UCP-FSS-DOM-INDEP, which does not use any control
knowledge! We speculate that this is because UCP-FSS explicitly calls a function to do
domain-specic reasoning in each recursive invocation while the synthesized planners have
domain control knowledge folded into the planner code (see Section 4).

5.4 Summary of Results

In summary, we have demonstrated that:

 The CLAY approach to writing domain-specic planning theory is exible. It sup-

ports mix-and-match of renements and control knowledge in generating a variety of
customized planners. As examples, we presented planners for blocks world, logistics
domain and Tyre domain, using forward and backward state space renements and
dierent types of domain-specic control knowledge.
 The synthesized planners can exploit domain dependent control knowledge to improve performance. We showed that, in fact, they are better able to exploit domain
knowledge than the traditional planners can.

6. Related Work

The research reported here straddles the two elds of automated software synthesis and
AI planning. Although our research is the rst to address the issue of planner synthesis,
synthesis of other types of search engines has been addressed by Smith and his co-workers.
Of particular interest to us is the work they did in developing automated scheduling software
for transportation logistics problems using KIDS system (Smith & Parra, 1993; Burstein &
Smith, 1996). The scheduling systems they have generated have been shown to signicantly
119

Srivastava & Kambhampati

outperform general-purpose schedulers working on the same problem. Their results provided
the initial impetus for our research. Although their original work used a design tactic
based on global search to model scheduling, they have also since then developed design
tactics based on other local search regimes. Another interesting issue brought up by their
work is the importance of \constraint propagation" techniques in deriving ecient code.
This has made us explore the role (or lack thereof) of constraint propagation in planning.
Kambhampati and Yang (1996) describe ways in which the renement planning framework
can be extended to exploit constraint satisfaction techniques. In future, we hope to be able
to synthesize planners using this more general theory of renement planning.
Although there has not been much work on automated planner synthesis, a notable exception is the work of Gomes (1995). Gomes had synthesized a state-space problem solver
for the \missionaries and cannibals" problem on KIDS, and has shown that the synthesized
code outperforms general purpose problem solvers in that domain. Our framework can be
seen as a generalization of the work done by Gomes. In particular, we separate planning
theories from the dynamics and the control knowledge, which in principle supports generation of planning code based on a variety of renements. We have demonstrated this by
deriving both progression and regression planners for three dierent domains (blocks world,
logistics and tyre world) and with two dierent bodies of control knowledge in each case.
Methodologically, our work adds to Gomes' results in that we have shown that given the
same control knowledge, planners generated by KIDS can outperform traditional planners
using the control knowledge at their choice points. This makes for a fairer comparison
between synthesized and general-purpose planners.
In some existing planners such as UCPOP (Penberthy & Weld, 1994) and PRODIGY
(Fink & Veloso, 1994), customization is supported by allowing the user to specify search
control rules that are checked at every choice point during search. Such control rules can
be used to rank the search nodes based on some heuristic, or prune unpromising nodes.
The main dierence between these approaches and the synthesis approach described here
is that ours supports a higher degree of integration of domain knowledge into the planner
by folding it into the synthesized code for the planner. Planners using search control rules
cannot do context dependent analysis or incremental application of control knowledge. In
contrast, in our approach, the control information is encoded declaratively and the planning
algorithm can be optimized based on all the knowledge that is available, including the
control knowledge.
Our work on utilizing explicit control knowledge in addition to domain dynamics in
deriving planning code has some parallels with the recent work by Bacchus and Kabanza
(1995). They concentrate on providing a rich language in which control knowledge can be
specied for a progression planner. They describe a language based on temporal logic to
specify domain control rules. Rather than using this knowledge to prune bad plans after
they are generated, Bacchus and Kabanza explore ways of incrementally tracking the level
of satisfaction of the control axioms as the planning progresses. Our approach facilitates
the same, in a renement independent setting, by \folding in" the control knowledge into
the developed planning code, with the help of KIDS framework.
There is some work in constraint satisfaction community that is directed towards producing specialized (customized) programs that is relevant to the research described here.
COASTOOL (Yoshikawa, Kaneko, Nomura, & Watanabe, 1994) and ALICE systems (Lau120

Synthesizing Customized Planners from Specifications

riere, 1978) take declarative description of CSPs and compile specialized algorithms for solving them, and MULTI-TAC (Minton, 1996) supports automatic conguration of constraint
satisfaction programs. The MULTI-TAC system, in particular, provides an interesting contrast to our approach. MULTI-TAC starts with an algorithm schema, a list of high level
heuristic rules for various decision points (e.g., \most-constrained-variable-rst" heuristic
for variable selection and \least-constraining-value-rst" for value selection in CSP search),
and a list of ags indicating whether certain procedures (e.g., forward checking in CSP) will
or will not be used. MULTI-TAC uses the domain specication to specialize the high-level
heuristics given to it. For example, in the context of a minimum maximal matching problem
in graph theory, a most-constrained-variable-rst heuristic may become \choose the edge
with the most neighbors that have been assigned values" . A conguration is a particular
subset of specialized heuristics to be used, and a particular assignment of ags. MULTITAC rst searches through a space of \congurations" to see which conguration best ts
a given problem population. Once the best conguration is found, it is then automatically
compiled into ecient code by using specication renement techniques similar to those
that we described in Section 3.5.
MULTI-TAC thus presents an interesting middle-ground between search control rule
specication approach used in UCPOP and PRODIGY planners, and the full integration of
domain-knowledge into the synthesized code, promised by the CLAY approach. In contrast
to the UCPOP and PRODIGY search control rule approach, the MULTI-TAC compilation
phase can support folding-in of search control rules into the compiled code. In contrast
to CLAY which advocates semi-automatic synthesis of a piece of software by manually
guided optimization (through the help of user specied distributive and monotonicity laws),
MULTI-TAC supports fully automating the customization of a congurable template. For
the CLAY approach to be eective, we need to provide a declarative specication of the
task and the domain control knowledge, as well as high level algorithm tactics. KIDS
deals with instantiating the tactics into the specic problem, but the simplication needs to
be guided by careful specication of distributive/monotonicity laws. In contrast, MULTITAC's conguration approach needs an algorithm template that is already semi-customized
to the specic task, with built-in hooks for using heuristics. The heuristics themselves are
specied in the form of meta-heuristic knowledge.
In MULTI-TAC, domain knowledge is used only in specializing the meta-heuristics. In
theory, the CLAY approach may support a deeper integration of the domain knowledge into
the synthesized code; but at the expense of a signicant amount of user intervention. An
interesting application of the MULTI-TAC approach in the context of planning might involve
starting with a UCP planning shell (which can be congured to emulate many varieties of
planners), a list of high-level heuristics for guiding the decision points in the UCP shell
(e.g., renement selection, aw selection etc), and searching among the congurations to
pick a planner for the given problem distribution.

7. Conclusion

In this research, we investigated the feasibility of using automated software synthesis tools
to synthesize customized domain-specic planners. We described the CLAY architecture
for exibly synthesizing ecient domain dependent classical planners from a declarative
121

Srivastava & Kambhampati

theory of planning and domain theory using a software synthesis system (KIDS). Using
this framework, any classical planner can be synthesized enriched with domain control
knowledge. As a proof of concept, forward state-space and backward state-space planners
were synthesized for the blocks-world, the logistics and the tyre world domains. We have
shown that the synthesized planners can outperform general purpose planners when both
are using the same amount of domain-specic control knowledge and argueed that this is
due to their ability to fold-in domain specic control knowledge into the planner code. In
contrast, the domain independent planners test the control knowledge for each plan being
rened, and thus suer a signicant application overhead.

7.1 Features and Limitations

Our synthesis approach provides several interesting contrasts to main-stream AI planning
work. To begin with, most AI planning work attempts to improve the eciency of planning
by concentrating on the way plans are generated. Our work diers radically in that we
concentrate on how \ecient planners" are synthesized. The use of software synthesis techniques lends modularity to the planner synthesis activity. The planning theory is specied
declaratively rather than in the form of an implemented program. This supports changes
and extensions to the planning theory. While a planning theory is described independent
of domains, control knowledge and dynamical knowledge of the domain can be specied
once for each domain. By selecting dierent combinations of planning theory and control
knowledge, we can synthesize a variety of domain-customized renement planners.
Despite these promises, our approach does entail several overheads. Some of these
overheads are related to the current state of the art in automated software synthesis while
others are related to our current implementation of CLAY architecture. In what follows,
we try to tease these apart.
The holy grail of automated software synthesis approaches is to free the users from lowlevel coding, and allow them to concentrate on declarative specication. While the KIDS
system comes closest to this promise, it is still far from perfect. To start with, the user must
be reasonably familiar with the software synthesis process in order to do anything substantial
with KIDS. We had to go through a steep learning curve before we could understand how to
structure our theories to make good use of the optimizations provided by KIDS. Writing the
monotonic and distributive laws for operations such that they can help KIDS do eective
code simplication is still somewhat of an art. Many times, we had to go back and rewrite
the domain knowledge after KIDS was unsuccessful in using the knowledge provided to it.
Advances in software synthesis technology may provide support for automatic translation
for high level control knowledge into forms suitable for consumption by KIDS; but such
support is not available right now.
The current cost-benet ratios are such that we would not recommend using CLAY/KIDS
approach for customizing a planner if one is interested in customizing a single planner for
a single domain. The REFINE code the user writes to specify the synthesis task is typically larger than any one single synthesized planner generated by KIDS. Thus, manually
customizing the planner for the domain may still be more appropriate. However, the synthesized approaches may be competitive if we are interested in being able to customize a
variety of planners to a variety of domains.
122

Synthesizing Customized Planners from Specifications

In addition to the overheads entailed by KIDS, our specic implementation of planning
theories, domain knowledge, etc. also lead to some ineciencies. These latter can be
eliminated by a better design of the CLAY architecture. For example, to make our work
simple, we decided to go with one of the pre-existing canned design tactics provided by
KIDS, and chose the global search theory over nite sequences as the candidate tactic.
Because of this choice, we found state-variable representation of domains to be more suitable
from an implementation point of view. Although getting state-variable representations of
actions is not very hard (we wrote a couple of utility routines for converting actions in
STRIPS representation into state-variable representation), specifying control knowledge in
terms of this representation turned out to be less than natural, especially in larger domains
like Russel's tyre world.
Our choice of in-built design tactics also limited the types of domain knowledge we could
specify. Most of the control knowledge had to be in the form of node-rejection rules. General
global search also allows node-preference knowledge as well as knowledge regarding eective
ways of shrinking the set of potential solutions, without splitting the set (by eliminating
non-solutions).
We could eliminate the awkwardness of state-variable representations as well as exploit more types of domain knowledge by designing global search tactics specially suited
to planning-specic data structures. Although eventually the KIDS system may support a
larger variety of design tactics, customizing design tactics to task classes is very much in
line with the current practice in automated software synthesis (Gomes, Smith, & Westfold,
1996).

7.2 Future Directions

The work presented here can be seen as the beginning of a fairly open-ended research program that complements, rather than competes with, the research into ecient planning
algorithms. Ideally, we would like to support the synthesis of customized planners based
on the full gamut of planning technologies including partial order and task-reduction planning. These latter are already subsumed by the renement planning framework developed
in (Kambhampati & Srivastava, 1996) and supporting their synthesis is mainly a matter
of supporting a more exible partial plan representation in KIDS (representing plans as
sequences over actions has suced until now, as we were only addressing the synthesis of
state-space planners). We are currently in the process of doing this (Srivastava, Kambhampati, & Mali, 1997).
More generally, any time we get insights into the internal workings of a family of planning algorithms, we would like to translate those insights into declarative specications for
KIDS and support synthesis of more ecient customized domain code. An example of this
is the recent research on plan synthesis approaches based on constraint satisfaction. In fact,
domain independent planners such as Graphplan (Blum & Furst, 1995) can solve our test
suites in equal or better time compared to the synthesized planners. We have taken some
preliminary steps towards integrating these approaches into the renement planning framework by using the notion of disjunctive renement planning (see Kambhampati & Yang,
1996; Kambhampati, 1997b; Kambhampati, Parker, & Lambrecht, 1997; Kambhampati,
123

Srivastava & Kambhampati

1997a). In future, as this work matures, we intend to explore synthesis of planners using
the theories of disjunctive plan renement.

Abstract

An important characteristic of many logics for Articial Intelligence is their nonmonotonicity. This means that adding a formula to the premises can invalidate some of the
consequences. There may, however, exist formulae that can always be safely added to the
premises without destroying any of the consequences: we say they respect monotonicity.
Also, there may be formulae that, when they are a consequence, can not be invalidated
when adding any formula to the premises: we call them conservative. We study these
two classes of formulae for preferential logics, and show that they are closely linked to the
formulae whose truth-value is preserved along the (preferential) ordering. We will consider some preferential logics for illustration, and prove syntactic characterization results
for them. The results in this paper may improve the eciency of theorem provers for
preferential logics.

1. Introduction
Over the past decades, many non-classical logics for Articial Intelligence have been dened
and investigated. The need for such logics arose from the unsuitability of classical logics to
describe defeasible reasoning. These classical logics are monotonic, which means that their
consequence relation (j) satises:
8; ; '

: ( j  )  ^ ' j  )

(Monotonicity)

This means that whenever we learn new information (') and add this to what we already
know (), all the old theorems ( ) are still derivable. This is clearly undesirable when
describing defeasible reasoning. Therefore, monotonicity is not satised by many logics for
Articial Intelligence.
On the other hand, monotonicity is a very attractive feature from a practical point of
view. When learning new information, we do not have to start all over again, but we can
retain our old conclusions, and focus on deriving possible new ones. Furthermore, when we
have a lot of information, we are allowed to focus on only part of it. Conclusions derived
from this part are then automatically also valid when considering all the information we
have (this is sometimes called local reasoning).
Even though it is clear that we do not want monotonicity to hold in general, it might
be worthwhile to investigate restricted variants of monotonicity. In the past, such variants
have been dened which allow us to keep the old theorems, when either the new information follows from the old premise (this variant is called Cautious Monotonicity by Kraus,
Lehmann, & Magidor, 1990) or its negation can not be derived from the old premise (this
is called Rational Monotonicity by Kraus et al., 1990).

We will take a somewhat dierent perspective, and consider two classes of formulae: the
class of formulae that can always be added to a premise without invalidating old conclusions
(we say these formulae respect monotonicity), and the class of formulae which can always be
retained as conclusions, no matter which new information is added to the premise (we say
these formulae are conservative). The advantages of monotonicity sketched above would
still hold when we restrict ' to the class of formulae that respect monotonicity, or when
we restrict  to be conservative. Whether such classes exist, and what these classes are,
depends of course on the particular nonmonotonic logic considered. We will focus here on
an important class of nonmonotonic logics: the class of preferential logics (Shoham, 1987,
1988). These logics are based on a monotonic logic (such as propositional logic, predicate
logic or modal logic) augmented with a preference order on its models. The nonmonotonic
consequences of a formula  are those formulae which are true in all models of  which
are minimal in the preference order among all models of  (an extensive discussion of
preferential logics is provided by van Benthem, 1989). We will give a formal denition.

Denition 1 (Preferential logic) A preferential logic consists of a language L, a class

of models Mod together with a satisfaction relation j= between models and formulae, and
a partial order  on Mod. A model m 2 Mod is called a minimal model of a formula 
(denoted m j= ) if m j=  and for all models n, if n  m and n j=  then n = m.
Preferential entailment (j= ) between formulae is dened as follows: for ;  2 L :  j= 
if  is true in all minimal models of .

Our presentation uses a partial order, i.e., a reexive, antisymmetric and transitive
relation. Shoham (1987) uses a strict partial order, i.e., an irreexive transitive relation,
with a slightly dierent notion of minimal model. The presentations can be translated into
each other.
It will turn out that formulae whose truth is preserved when going to more preferred
or less preferred models, play an important role with respect to the two classes of formulae
dened above (the class of formulae that respect monotonicity, and the class of conservative
formulae). We will rst give a denition.

Denition 2 (Persistence) Given a preferential logic (L; Mod; j=; ), a formula  2 L is
called downward persistent in this logic, if

8m; n 2 Mod : (m j= 

and n  m) ) n j= ;

and it is called upward persistent if
8m; n 2 Mod : (n j= 

and n  m) ) m j= :

In the next section, we will introduce some preferential logics to illustrate the material
in the rest of the paper. In Section 3 we will consider formulae that respect monotonicity,
and in Section 4 conservative formulae will be treated. The practical implications of the
results of this paper are discussed in Section 5. Section 6 gives conclusions and suggestions
for further research. Part of the material in this paper appeared in (Engelfriet, 1996b).

Monotonicity and Persistence in Preferential Logics

2. Some Preferential Logics

In this section we will describe the following preferential logics: Ground S5, Minimal Temporal Epistemic Logic and Circumscription. Since we have already dened preferential
entailment in general, for each logic we only have to give its ingredients, i.e., L; Mod; j=,
and . The preferential entailment relation is then xed by Denition 1. The rst logic we
will consider is Ground S5.

2.1 Ground S5

Ground S5 is a nonmonotonic modal logic for auto-epistemic reasoning, originally proposed
by Halpern and Moses (1985). Their aim was to formalize statements of the form "I only
know '". It allows, for example, to derive that an agent which only knows p, does not
know q. Ground S5 falls into the general scheme of ground nonmonotonic modal logics
(Donini, Nardi, & Rosati, 1997). A lot of interest is devoted to logics of minimal knowledge
(Levesque, 1990; Schwarz & Truszczynski, 1994; Chen, 1997; Halpern, 1997).
Semantically, states in which an agent only knows ', are states in which ' is known, but
otherwise the amount of knowledge is minimal. We will use a modal propositional language
to express the knowledge of the agent, and S5 will be the monotonic logic. We will give a
treatment of Ground S5 slightly dierent, but equivalent to the one given by Halpern and
Moses (1985).

Denition 3 (Epistemic language) Let P be a (nite or countably innite) set of propositional atoms. The language LS5 is the smallest set closed under:


if p 2 P then p 2 LS5 ;



if ';

2 LS5

then K'; ' ^ ; :' 2 LS5 .

Furthermore, we introduce the following abbreviations:

'_

 :(:' ^ :

); ' !

 :' _

; M'  :K :'; >  p _ :p; ?  :>:

If every atom occurring in a formula ' is in the scope of a K operator, we call ' subjective.

An example of a subjective formula is :Kp ^ K (q ! p), whereas K (p ^ q) _ s is not
subjective. In the rest of this paper we will only be interested in subjective formulae: they
describe (just) the knowledge and ignorance of the agent.
In the usual S5 semantics, a model is a triple (W; R; ), where W is a set of worlds, R is
an equivalence relation on W and  is a function that assigns a propositional valuation to
each world in W . We may however, in the case of one agent, restrict ourselves to normal S5
models, in which the relation is universal (each world is accessible from every world), and
worlds are identied with propositional valuations (a proof of soundness and completeness
of S5 with respect to these semantics is given by Meyer & van der Hoek, 1995).

Denition 4 (S5 semantics) Let P be a (nite or countably innite) set of propositional

atoms. A propositional valuation is a function from P into f0; 1g where 0 stands for false
and 1 for true. The set of all such valuations will be denoted by Mod(P ). A normal S5
3

Engelfriet

model M is a non-empty subset of Mod(P ). The truth of an S5 formula ' in such a model,
evaluated in a world m 2 M , denoted (M; m) j=S5 ', is dened inductively:
1: (M; m) j=S5 p
, m(p) = 1, for p 2 P
2: (M; m) j=S5 ' ^ , (M; m) j=S5 ' and (M; m) j=S5
3: (M; m) j=S5 :' , it is not the case that (M; m) j=S5 '
4: (M; m) j=S5 K' , (M; m0 ) j=S5 ' for every m0 2 M
We have the following elementary results on subjective formulae. The proofs are straightforward.

Proposition 5 (Subjective formulae)

1. Let ' be a subjective formula. For a normal S5 model M and m1 ; m2 2 M it holds:
(M; m1 ) j=S5 ' , (M; m2 ) j=S5 ':
We dene M j=S5 ' if (M; m) j=S5 ' for some, or, equivalently, all m 2 M . The set
of all normal S5 models, sometimes called information states, is denoted by IS.
2. An S5 formula ' is subjective if and only if it is equivalent to a formula of the form
K' with ' 2 LS5.
A subjective formula describes the knowledge of an agent, but we want to formalize that
this is all the agent knows. Therefore we are looking for models in which the knowledge of
the agent is minimal, or in other words, in which the ignorance of the agent is maximal. We
introduce a preference order over information states which favors models with less knowledge. The denition of this ordering is based on the observation that the more valuations
the agent considers possible, the less knowledge the agent has. Indeed, for any propositional
formula ' we have: if M1 j= K' and M1  M2 then M2 j= K'.
Denition 6 (Degree of knowledge) We dene the degree-of-knowledge ordering  on
normal S5 models as follows: for M1 ; M2 2 IS : M1  M2 , M1  M2 .
Ground S5 is the preferential logic based on this ordering.
Denition 7 (Ground S5) Ground S5 is the preferential logic with the subjective formulae of LS5 as its language, IS as its class of models, the satisfaction relation of Proposition 5
and the ordering of Denition 6. We will denote preferential entailment (as dened in Definition 1) of Ground S5 by j=GS5 .
The reader can now check that, for instance, Kp j=GS5 :Kq. The (unique) minimal
S5 model of Kp consists of all propositional valuations in which p is true, and this indeed
contains a model in which q is false. The entailment relation is nonmonotonic since Kp ^
Kq 6j=GS5 :Kq. Another example illustrates the minimality of the agent's knowledge: Kp _
Kq j=GS5 :(Kp ^ Kq).
Let us dene a consequence relation j by ' j if K' j=GS5 K . Then it turns out
that this is the consequence relation of Halpern and Moses (1985), apart from the fact that
they only dened it for premises which have a unique minimal model. Premises with a
unique minimal model are called honest. To give an example, the formula Kp is honest,
but Kp _ Kq is not: both the S5 model consisting of all valuations in which p is true, and
the model with all valuations in which q is true, are minimal models.

Monotonicity and Persistence in Preferential Logics

2.2 Minimal Temporal Epistemic Logic

In Ground S5, we are only able to express something about `all the agent knows' at a
particular instant. We will extend this logic in such a way that we are also able to say
something about the changing knowledge of the agent over time. Originally, this extended
logic was intended as a means of specifying nonmonotonic reasoning processes and of reasoning about their properties (Engelfriet & Treur, 1994, 1996; Engelfriet, 1996a). The idea
is that a temporal formula describes the nonmonotonic inferences the agent has to perform
during the course of a reasoning process (analogously to the use of temporal logic for specifying computer processes). But these inferences should also be the only cause of increases
in the agent's knowledge. Therefore, we again have to minimize the agent's knowledge, but
now over time (analogously to the use of minimization for dealing with the frame problem
in temporal logics for describing action and change, Shoham, 1988). To this end, we will
temporalize the epistemic language, epistemic models and the degree-of-knowledge ordering.
In order to describe past and future we introduce temporal operators P; H; F; G and
2, denoting respectively \sometimes in the past", \always in the past", \sometimes in the
future", \always in the future" and \always". We do not want to describe the agent's knowledge of the future and past, but the future and past of the agent's knowledge. Therefore,
temporal operators are not allowed to occur within the scope of the epistemic K operator.

Denition 8 (Temporal epistemic language) The language
closed under:


if ' 2 LS5 then ' 2 LTEL ;



if ;  2 LTEL then  ^ ; :; P; F 2 LTEL .

LTEL

is the smallest set

Again the abbreviations for _; !; > and ? are introduced, as well as:

G  :F (:); H  :P (:) and 2  H ^  ^ G:
If in the rst clause we restrict ourselves to subjective formulae, we get the set of subjective
TEL formulae.

In the rest of this paper we will be interested in subjective TEL formulae since they
describe how the knowledge of the agent is changing over time. Based on the set of natural
numbers (N) as ow of time, and normal S5 models as formalization of states in a temporal
model, the following semantics is introduced for temporal epistemic logic (TEL):

Denition 9 (Semantics of TEL) A TEL model is a function M : N ! IS . The truth
of a formula ' 2 LTEL in M at time point t 2 N, denoted (M; t) j= ', is dened inductively
as follows:

1:
2:
3:
4:
5:

(M; t) j= '
(M; t) j= ' ^
(M; t) j= :'
(M; t) j= P'
(M; t) j= F'

, M(t) j=S5 ', if ' 2 LS5
, (M; t) j= ' and (M; t) j=
, it is not the case that (M; t) j= '
, 9s 2
such that s < t and (M; s) j= '
, 9s 2
such that t < s and (M; s) j= '

N

Engelfriet

A formula ' is true in a model M , denoted M j= ', if (M; 0) j= '. A TEL model M
is called conservative (or a TELC model) if for all s < t 2 N : M(s)  M(t), with the
ordering  of Denition 6. The set of TELC models is denoted by TCIS.

Note that the above denition is in principle ambiguous: a formula like Kp ^ Kq is
an S5 formula which can be interpreted according to the rst semantic clause, but it can
also be seen as a conjunction, to be interpreted according to the second clause. As the
interpretation of the conjunction (and the same holds for negation) is the same in S5 as in
TEL, this ambiguity is harmless.
We will briey explain the reason we have dened M j= ' if (M; 0) j= '. Later on, we
will make the general assumption on preferential logics that the language contains negation,
and that m j= :' if and only if m 6j= ' (Assumption 1). If we dene M j= ' if (M; t) j= '
for all t 2 N, then this assumption would not hold for TEL. The two denitions can be
translated into each other, since (M; 0) j= ' if and only if (M; t) j= :P > ! ' for all t 2 N
and (M; t) j= ' for all t 2 N if and only if (M; 0) j= ' ^ G'. This is also one of the reasons
we gave a slightly dierent presentation of Ground S5 (using subjective formulae).
In conservative models, the propositional knowledge of an agent can only increase in
time. We will restrict ourselves to these models, i.e., an agent can not forget or revise its
(propositional) knowledge. Indeed, for a propositional formula ' and a TELC model M , if
(M; t) j= K' then (M; s) j= K' for all s > t. This restriction can be made when the agent
is reasoning about a xed (non-changing) situation, and we are abstracting from particular
implementation details (such as the use of backtracking implementations for nonmonotonic
logics). We now extend the ordering and minimal consequence relation to TELC models.
The ordering is extended in a pointwise fashion.

Denition 10 (Minimal temporal epistemic logic)
1. We extend the degree-of-knowledge ordering to TELC models by dening
MN ,

for all s 2 N : M(s)  N (s):

2. Minimal temporal epistemic logic (MTEL) is the preferential logic with the subjective
TEL formulae as its language, TCIS as its class of models, the satisfaction relation
(M j= ') of Denition 9 and the ordering of item 1. We will denote preferential
entailment (as dened in Denition 1) of MTEL by j=MTEL.

The idea behind using MTEL for specifying reasoning processes is that a subjective
TEL formula ' describes the reasoning of an agent over time (it can, for example, describe
the use of nonmonotonic inference rules, see Proposition 11). The minimal models of '
represent the process of the agent reasoning in time. We can then use minimal consequence
to infer properties of this reasoning process.
It is easy to see that MTEL is a generalization of Ground S5: for subjective S5 formulae
'; we have that ' j=MTEL if and only if ' j=GS5 . As an example of the use of the
notion of minimal temporal epistemic consequence, it has been shown by Engelfriet and
Treur (1993) that it can capture default logic (Reiter, 1980b).
6

Monotonicity and Persistence in Preferential Logics

Proposition 11 (Default logic in MTEL) Let a nite, propositional default theory  =

hW; D i

be given and let

^

^

= f2(K ^ G(:K : ) ! G(K )) j (;  )= 2 Dg ^ fK j  2 W g:
Then ' is a sceptical consequence of  in default logic if and only if j=MTEL F (K').
The conjuncts of the form 2(K ^ G(:K : ) ! G(K )) ensure the application of the
default rules. In words: if the agent knows the prerequisite (), and the justication ( )
remains consistent with what the agent knows throughout the future, then the agent must
conclude the consequent ( ) in the next moment in time (and it will know  henceforth).

2.3 Circumscription

One of the earliest approaches to nonmonotonic reasoning is circumscription (McCarthy,
1977, 1980; Davis, 1980; Lifschitz, 1994; Etherington, 1988), a preferential logic based on
rst-order predicate logic. The main idea behind circumscription is a kind of completeness
of information given to us: \the premises as stated give us `the whole truth' about the
matter" (van Benthem, 1989). This leads to at least two kinds of minimality: predicateminimality and domain-minimality. The intuition behind predicate-minimality is that for
some relevant property (predicate), all objects that have this property, are explicitly said
to have this property in the premise. This allows us to formulate defaults stating that all
normal objects have some property. Minimizing abnormality will allow us to conclude an
object has this property, unless we can deduce from the premise that this object is abnormal.
The intuition behind domain-minimality, is that the domain (of discourse) contains no other
objects than those that can be deduced to exist from the premise. (This intuition is strongly
tied to the domain-closure assumption of Reiter, 1980a). These two kinds of minimality are
formalized by two variants of Circumscription. Both of them will be treated below.
The classical logic underlying circumscription is rst-order predicate logic. We assume
a standard rst-order language L with a nite number of predicate symbols, including
equality. We will also assume that the language contains no function or constant symbols.
This is not a severe limitation, since we can eliminate function and constant symbols by
introducing new predicate symbols (Davis, 1980). We will rst give the denition of the
orderings and then dene predicate and domain circumscriptive consequence.

Denition 12

1. Let P be a predicate symbol in the language L. For a structure M for the language,
P M denotes the interpretation of P in M (so P M is a subset of dom(M )n , where
dom(M ) is the domain of M , and n is the arity of P ). For two structures M; N ,
we say M is P -preferred to N , denoted M P N , if they have the same domain,
the same interpretation of predicate symbols other than P , and P M  P N . Predicate
circumscription of P is the preferential logic which uses rst-order predicate logic for
the language, models and satisfaction relation, augmented with the ordering P . We
will denote preferential entailment (as dened in Denition 1) in this logic by j=PC
P .
2. For two structures M; N for the language L, we say N is a substructure of M , denoted
N d M , if the domain of N is a subset of the domain of M , and the interpretation
7

Engelfriet

of each predicate symbol in N is the restriction of the corresponding interpretation in
M to dom(N ). Domain circumscription is the preferential logic which uses rst-order
predicate logic for the language, models and satisfaction relation, augmented with the
ordering d . We will denote preferential entailment in this logic by j=DC .
3. If we restrict the model class to nite structures, the resulting preferential logics are
called nite predicate circumscription and nite domain circumscription.

We refer the reader to the references given above for standard results and motivation of
circumscription.

3. Respecting Monotonicity

In this section we will study formulae which respect monotonicity. We will rst give a
formal denition.

Denition 13 (Respecting monotonicity) Given a preferential logic, we say a formula
' respects monotonicity, if

8; 

:  j=  )  ^ ' j= :

Next, we will make some basic assumptions about the (underlying logic of the) preferential logic.

Assumption 1 From now on we will assume that any preferential logic satises the following:


the language has conjunction (^) and m j= ' ^

, m j= '



the language has implication (!) and m j= ' !



the language has negation (:) and m j= :' , m 6j= '.

and m j= .

, m 6j= '

or m j= .

We can then immediately identify a class of formulae that respect monotonicity:

Proposition 14 Downward persistent formulae respect monotonicity.
Proof: Suppose ' is downward persistent. Let ;  be formulae and suppose  j=  . Let

m be a minimal model of  ^ '. Then it is also a minimal model of . For suppose it is not,
then there exists n  m, n 6= m and n j= . Since m j= ' and ' is downward persistent, we
have n j= '. But then n j=  ^ ' which contradicts the assumption that m was a minimal
model of  ^ '. Since m is a minimal model of  and  j=  , we have m j=  . We have
proved that  ^ ' j=  . Thus, ' respects monotonicity.
2
Of course, valid and unsatisable sentences are downward persistent. But the question is whether non-trivial downward persistent formulae exist. For the preferential logics
introduced in Section 2, the answer is armative.
8

Monotonicity and Persistence in Preferential Logics

Denition 15 (DIAM) Dene the class of S5 formulae DIAM by:
DIAM ::= M (') j DIAM ^ DIAM j DIAM _ DIAM j M (DIAM)
where ' is propositional.

Formulae from DIAM essentially only contain the M operator (the `diamond' of S5, and
not the `box' operator K ). Formulae in this class are the only subjective formulae (up to
equivalence) which are downward persistent in Ground S5 (this was proved by Engelfriet,
1996a).

Theorem 16 A subjective S5 formula ' is downward persistent in Ground S5 if and only
if it is S5-equivalent to a formula in DIAM.

So in Ground S5 there is a non-empty class of downward persistent formulae, that
respect monotonicity by Proposition 14. Essentially, these formulae only say something
about the ignorance of the agent. One might think that formulae from DIAM are completely
uninteresting, and never yield any new insights in Ground S5. The converse of monotonicity
for these formulae,  ^ ' j=GS5  )  j=GS5  , however, does not hold, even when ' is
consistent with . We do not have that Kp _ Kq j=GS5 Kq, whereas we do have that
(Kp _ Kq) ^ M (:p) j=GS5 Kq with M (:p) 2 DIAM. So knowledge of ignorance can be
useful.
An analogous result holds for minimal temporal epistemic logic.

Denition 17 (TD)
1. Dene
TD ::= DIAM j TD ^ TD j TD _ TD j F (TD) j G(TD) j P (TD) j H (TD)
2. For two subjective TEL formulae '; :

'

,def

for all TELC models M : M j= ' , M j= :

TD stands for `temporal diamond' formulae. The following was also proved by Engelfriet
(1996a).

Theorem 18 In MTEL, a formula ' is downward persistent if and only if it is equivalent
(in the sense of ) to a formula in TD.

As in the case of Ground S5, these formulae express (temporal) ignorance of the agent.

Denition 19 (Positive and universal formulae) A rst-order predicate formula is negative in a predicate P , if all occurrences of the predicate P are in the scope of an odd number
of negations. A formula is universal if it is of the form 8x1 : : : xn where is quantier
free.
9

Engelfriet

The following result links these formulae to downward persistence in circumscription.
The rst is a variant of Lyndon's theorem and is folklore (we leave the details to the
reader); the second result is known as the Los-Tarski theorem (Chang & Keisler, 1990,
Theorem 3.2.2).

Theorem 20
1. A rst-order predicate formula ' is downward persistent in predicate circumscription
(of P ) if and only if it is equivalent to a formula that is negative in P .
2. A rst-order predicate formula ' is downward persistent in domain circumscription if
and only if it is equivalent to a universal formula.

So downward persistent formulae in predicate circumscription essentially only say something about elements not having property P (besides the other properties they mention),
and downward persistent formulae in domain circumscription essentially only mention universal properties (and do not say anything about the existence of objects).
For our examples, we have shown that non-trivial classes of formulae that respect monotonicity exist. The question is whether there are more such formulae, besides those that are
downward persistent. We will give a criterion that ensures that there are no more formulae
that respect monotonicity.

Denition 21 (Expressibility of preference) A preferential logic satises expressibility of preference if the following holds:

8m 2 Mod : 9'm 2 L : 8n 2 Mod : (n j= 'm , m  n):

The formula 'm expresses: \I am less preferred than m," and describes exactly those
models which are larger in the preferential ordering. The criterion of expressibility of
preference poses a requirement on the expressiveness of the language, given its semantics.
We will prove that in preferential logics that satisfy the condition in this denition, the
downward persistent formulae are the only ones that respect monotonicity. The above
condition can be generalized by taking into account equivalent models; we have not done
this immediately as it makes things rather cumbersome. If whenever n  m and m  k
(where m  k means that m and k satisfy the same formulae), there exists a model l such
that l  n and l  k, then we can generalize the condition to: 8m 2 Mod : 9'm 2 L : 8n 2
Mod : (n j= 'm , 9k 2 Mod : m  k & k  n).

Theorem 22 (Only if : : : ) For a preferential logic that satises expressibility of preference we have: if a formula respect monotonicity, then it is downward persistent.

Proof: Suppose a formula ' is not downward persistent, then there exist models m and

n such that m j= ', n 6j= ' and n  m. Dene  = 'n ^ (' ! 'm ) and  = :'. First
we claim that  j=  . Since n  n, we have n j= 'n , and as n 6j= ' we get n j= .
Furthermore, for any model k, if k j=  then in particular k j= 'n so n  k. Therefore,
n is the only minimal model of , and since n 6j= ', we have n j=  . On the other hand,
 ^ ' 6j=  : n  m so m j= 'n and m  m so m j= 'm from which we conclude that m j=

so m j=  ^ '. Furthermore, for any model k, if k j=  ^ ', then k j= ' and k j= ' ! 'm
so k j= 'm . From this it follows that m  k, but this means that m is a (actually, the
only) minimal model of  ^ ' and m j= ' so m 6j=  . We conclude that ' does not respect
monotonicity, since we have found formulae  and  such that  j=  but  ^ ' 6j=  . 2
It may seem that the condition of expressibility of preference is too restrictive. However,
we will see that it is useful for the examples.

Proposition 23 For Ground S5, MTEL and nite predicate and domain circumscription,
only downward persistent formulae respect monotonicity.

Proof: Remark that all of these logics satisfy Assumption 1. First consider Ground S5.
Let us rst take the language to be nite (that is, P is nite). Take any
S5 model M .
V
m
m
For each
propositional valuation m, dene the formula  by  = fp 2 P j m j=
pg ^ Vf:Vp j p 2 P; m 6j= pg. This is a well-dened formula since P is nite. Now construct
'M = fK (:m ) j m 2= M g, which is again a well-dened formula since Mod(P ) is
nite. It can easily be seen that any S5 model N satises 'M if and only if M  N . So
expressibility of preference is satised, whence Theorem 22 ensures that only downward
persistent formulae respect monotonicity for this nite language. Now let P be arbitrary,
and suppose ' in this language respects monotonicity. Then it is easy to see that if we
restrict the language to atoms occurring in ', it still respects monotonicity, so it is downward
persistent in the restricted language. It follows easily that ' is also downward persistent in
the full language.
For MTEL, the same considerations make it sucient to give a formula 'M for a nite
language only, so let us take P nite. Then every S5 model M(i) is a nite set of propositional valuations. Since the sequence fM(i)g is decreasing with respect to set-inclusion
(as M is conservative), there will be an index k such that M(j ) = M(k) for all j > k.
To improve readability of the formula 'M we dene the formulae ati to be P i > ^ H i+1 ?
(where P i stands for a sequence of P operators of length i). It is easy to see that for any
model N we have (N ; j ) j= ati if and only if j = i. Now dene:
'M = Vf2(ati ! 'M(i) ) j 0  i  kg, where 'M(i) is the formula as dened in the case of
Ground S5 for the S5 model M(i) . It is easy to show that N j= 'M if and only if M  N .
For nite circumscription, we need the more general denition of expressibility of preference hinted at before (in rst-order logic, there may be equivalent models: dierent models
that satisfy the same rst-order formulae). Here we need not restrict the language. In
predicate circumscription, the required formula 'M for a nite structure M expresses: (i)
the exact number of elements of the domain of M , (ii) for which of these elements P holds,
and (iii) for all other predicates Q it expresses for which elements Q holds, and for which its
negation holds. In domain circumscription, the required formula 'M for a nite structure
M expresses the fact that there are (at least) as many elements as in M , and for each
predicate Q, it expresses for which of these elements Q holds, and for which elements its
negation holds.
2
It is not possible to nd the required formula 'M in (non-nite) circumscription in
general: for innite structures we are not in general able to express the number of elements,
11

Engelfriet

and we can not describe the entire extensions of predicates in general. Indeed, the above
result does not hold for domain circumscription. It is still an open question whether it holds
for predicate circumscription.

Proposition 24 For domain circumscription, there exists a rst-order predicate formula
which respects monotonicity but is not downward persistent.

Proof: Consider the rst-order language L = f<; =g, and let ' be a sentence stating that

< is a dense linear ordering without begin- or endpoint. This is a complete theory (Rabin,
1977, Theorem 4), which means that for any  2 L, either ' j=  or ' j= :. Now suppose
 j=DC  . If ' j= : then  ^ ' is inconsistent, so  ^ ' j=DC  trivially. Otherwise we
have that ' j=  so  ^ ' is equivalent to '. But it is easy to see that ' does not have a
minimal model, so again we have  ^ ' j=DC  . However, ' is not downward persistent: it
holds in the real numbers, but not in the substructure of the natural numbers.
2
Until now we have considered formulae that can be added to any premise, but we can
also ask the question whether a formula respects monotonicity for a given, xed premise.

Proposition 25 Given a preferential logic such that Mod is nite and for all m 2 Mod

there exists m 2 L such that n j= m if and only if n = m, let  be a xed formula in L.
Then we have for all ' 2 L:
8 ( j=

 )  ^ ' j=  ) , 8m 2 Mod(m j=  ^ ' ) m j= ):
Proof: The right to left direction is trivial (and does not depend on the assumption). For
the other direction, suppose that 8 ( j= W )  ^ ' j=  ). Let m 2 Mod be arbitrary
and suppose m j=  ^ '. Now dene  = fn j n j= g; this is a well-dened formula
since Mod was assumed nite. It is easy to see that  j=  : suppose n j= , then n
is one of the disjuncts of  , and by denition of n , we have n j= n , so n j=  . But the
assumption now gives that  ^ ' j=  . As m j=  ^ ', we have m j=  , so there is an
n 2 Mod with n j=  and m j= n. But by denition of n this means that m = n so
m j= .
2
Proposition 25 states that a formula ' respects monotonicity for a xed premise  if
and only if the minimal models of  ^ ' are minimal models of . Of course the criterion
on the right-hand side is hard to check; we can give another criterion, but for that, we rst
need the following denition (Kraus et al., 1990):

Denition 26 (Smoothness) A preferential logic is called smooth, if the following holds:
8 2 L : 8m 2 Mod : (m j=  ) 9n 2 Mod : n  m & n j= ):
This condition, which is also called stopperedness or well-foundedness, and is akin to
the limit assumption (Lewis, 1973), forbids chains of ever-decreasing models satisfying a
formula. It is one of the basic properties in the framework of Kraus et al. (1990).
Proposition 27 Given a smooth preferential logic, we have: 8m 2 Mod(m j=  ^ ' )
m j= ) if and only if 8m 2 Mod(m j=  ^ ' ) 9n 2 Mod(n  m; n j=  and n j= ')).
12

Monotonicity and Persistence in Preferential Logics

The proof of this proposition is straightforward, and again it may not help much. As
far as the examples are concerned, the conclusion of Proposition 25 holds for both Ground
S5 and MTEL (the properties depend only on  and ' so we may restrict the signature and
then use the proposition). Proposition 27 holds for Ground S5 (which is smooth). From
these propositions we can nd some sucient conditions. If ' is downward persistent in
the models of , then Proposition 25 ensures that ' respects monotonicity with respect to
. If  j= ' then Proposition 27 ensures that ' respects monotonicity with respect to 
(but this also follows immediately with the rule of Cautious Monotonicity, which is satised
in smooth preferential logics, Kraus et al., 1990). It seems hard to nd a simple criterion
necessary and sucient for respecting monotonicity for a given premise. We leave this for
further research.

4. Conservativity

In the previous section we have considered formulae that can always be added to a premise
without invalidating any of the conclusions. In this section we will focus on the conclusions,
and study formulae that, when they are concluded, can always be kept, no matter which
new information is added to the premise. We will call these formulae conservative.

Denition 28 (Conservative) Given a preferential logic, we say a formula  is conservative, if

8; ' :  j=

 )  ^ ' j= :

We have the following result connecting upward persistent and conservative formulae,
in analogy with Proposition 14.

Proposition 29 Given a preferential logic that is smooth, if a formula is upward persistent,
it is conservative.

Proof: Let  be upward persistent in a smooth preferential logic. Now suppose  j=  .
Take any model m such that m j=  ^ ', then m j=  so by smoothness, there is a model
n with n  m and n j= . Then, as  j=  , we have n j=  . Since n  m and  is
upward persistent, we have m j=  . This shows that  ^ ' j=  , so  is conservative. 2
Again, we can ask if the upward persistent formulae are the only conservative formulae,
and this is true under the same conditions as in the case of respecting monotonicity.
Proposition 30 (Only if : : : ) For a preferential logic that satises expressibility of preference we have: if a formula is conservative, then it is upward persistent.
Proof: Suppose  is not upward persistent, then there are n; m 2 Mod such that n  m,
and n j=  but m 6j=  . Now take  = 'n and ' = 'm . Then n is the only minimal model
of  and n j=  so  j=  , but m is a (actually, the only one) minimal model of  ^ ', and
m 6j=  , so  ^ ' 6j=  . Thus,  is not conservative.
2
Let us rst identify the upward persistent formulae for our examples. This is relatively
straightforward, since we have the following elementary result.
13

Engelfriet

Proposition 31 For any preferential logic, ' is upward persistent if and only if :' is
downward persistent.

This gives us the following.

Proposition 32
1. Dene BOX ::= K (') j BOX ^ BOX j BOX _ BOX j K (BOX) with ' propositional.
Then a subjective S5 formula ' is upward persistent in Ground S5 if and only if it is
S5-equivalent to a formula in BOX.
2. Dene TB ::= BOX j TB ^ TB j TB _ TB j F (TB) j G(TB) j P (TB) j H (TB). Then a
subjective TEL formula ' is upward persistent in MTEL if and only if it is equivalent
(in the sense of ) to a formula in TB.
3. A rst-order formula is upward persistent in predicate circumscription (of P ) if and
only if it is equivalent to a formula that is positive in P (meaning that all occurrences
of the predicate P are in the scope of an even number of negations). A rst-order
formula is upward persistent in domain circumscription if and only if it is equivalent
to an existential formula (a formula of the form 9x1 : : : xn where is quantier
free).

Proof: Straightforward.

2

In the above denition, formulae from BOX essentially only contain the K operator (the
`box' of S5); TB stands for `temporal box' formulae. Now let us see what Propositions 29
and 30 say about the examples. Ground S5 satises expressibility of preference (for a nite
language) and is smooth, so the conservative formulae are exactly the upward persistent
formulae, which express only knowledge (and not ignorance). This can be lifted again
to an innite language. The fact that in Ground S5, formulae that express propositional
knowledge, are conservative, was already noted by Donini et al. (1997). MTEL also satises
expressibility of preference (for a nite language), so any formula that is conservative, must
be upward persistent, and must be equivalent to a formula in TB, expressing knowledge
over time (not ignorance). This can be lifted to an innite language. Unfortunately, MTEL
is not smooth: the formula F (Kp) is satisable, but has no minimal model. In MTEL,
we have that F (Kp) j=MTEL F (Kq), but F (Kp) ^ Kp 6j=MTEL F (Kq) (F (Kp) ^ Kp has a
minimal model, in which only p is known, from the rst point in time onwards). This means
that the formula F (Kq) is not conservative, although it is upward persistent. It is easy to
see that in any preferential logic, valid formulae are always conservative, but in MTEL,
these are (almost) the only ones.

Denition 33 We call a TEL model M totally ignorant, if for all propositional formulae

' we have: if M j= F (K') then ' is a propositional tautology. Dene the totally ignorant
model Mti by Mti (i) = Mod(P ) for all i.
In a totally ignorant model, no knowledge is ever gained. The totally ignorant model is
certainly a totally ignorant model, and if P is nite, it is the only one.
14

Monotonicity and Persistence in Preferential Logics

Proposition 34 For MTEL, in case P is innite, we have that a formula is conservative
if and only if it is true in all models. When P is nite, a formula is conservative if and
only if it is true in all models except possibly the totally ignorant model.

Proof: We will prove that  is conservative if and only if it is true in all models that are not

totally ignorant (both when P is nite and when it is innite). First, suppose M is a model
that is not totally ignorant, in which  is not true. So M j= F (K ) for some propositional
formula  that is not a propositional tautology. If P is nite, we can consider the formula
'M (see the proof of Proposition 23 for the denition of 'M ). If P is innite, one can
show that M can be chosen in such a way that it is a `inherently nite' model, allowing the
construction of a formula 'M with the same properties as for the case when P is nite (using
essentially the same construction). The details of this argument are left to the reader. The
formula F (K ) does not have a minimal model ( must be known sometimes in the future,
but this moment can always be postponed, yielding a smaller model), so F (K ) j=MTEL  .
On the other hand, it can easily be shown that the only minimal model of F (K ) ^ 'M is
M , which gives us F (K ) ^ 'M 6j=MTEL  . This means that  is not conservative.
Now suppose that  is true in all models that are not totally ignorant, and suppose
 j=MTEL  . Let M be a minimal model of  ^ '. If M is not totally ignorant, then
M j=  . If it is totally ignorant, then also Mti j=  ^ ' (it can be shown by induction that
all totally ignorant models satisfy the same formulae). But then Mti j= . Since no model
is preferred over Mti , this means that Mti j=  so Mti j=  , whence M j=  . It follows
that  ^ ' j=MTEL  , so  is conservative.
Let us look at the case when P is innite. Suppose M 6j=  , with M totally ignorant.
Now take a propositional atom p not occurring in  . It can easily be shown that we can
nd a model of Kp in which  is not satised. This model is of course not totally ignorant.
This shows that if  is true in all models that are not totally ignorant, then it is true in all
models. In case P is nite, Mti is the only totally ignorant model.
2
So in MTEL with an innite P , valid formulae are the only conservative formulae.
These formulae are of course upward persistent (in a trivial way), and they are equivalent
to a formula in TB, for instance K (>). When the signature is nite, there are some extra
formulae that are conservative, for example if P = fp; qg, then the formula F (K (p _ q) _
K (:p _ q) _ K (p _ :q) _ K (:p _ :q)) is also conservative (it is true in all models except
the totally ignorant one). Of course, this formula is upward persistent, and it is in TB.
Finite predicate and domain circumscription satisfy both expressibility of preference
and smoothness, so the conservative formulae coincide with the upward persistent formulae
which have the syntactic characterization of Proposition 32.
Full circumscription satises neither of the conditions.

Proposition 35 In predicate and domain circumscription there are upward persistent formulae that are not conservative.

Proof: First consider predicate circumscription. Let the language consist of three predicates besides equality, namely P , Succ and < (and P is circumscribed). Dene the formulae
15

Engelfriet

 and ' as follows:
 = 8x9!y(Succ(x; y))^
' = 8xy(Px ^ Succ(y; x) ! Py)
8x9!y (Succ(y; x))^
8xy (Succ(x; y ) ! x < y )^
8xyz (x < y ^ y < z ! x < z )^
8x(:(x < x))^
8xy (x < y _ y < x _ x = y )^
9xPx
8xy (Px ^ Succ(x; y ) ! Py )
The intuitive meaning of  is that there are Succ-chains of elements, extending indenitely
in both directions. If P occurs somewhere on such a chain, it must be true in all successors
as well. A model of  can be made smaller (more preferred) by making P false in a point
and all of its predecessors (leaving it true in all successors). We will now make this argument
formal. The rst claim is that  has no P - minimal models. Let M be a model of . Then
there must be an x 2 dom(M ) with x 2 P M . Dene A = fxg [ fy 2 P M j (y; x) 2<M g.
Let N be the structure with the same domain as M , the same extension of Succ and <, and
P N = P M n A. It is straightforward to verify that N is a model of , and that N P M
and N 6= M .
On the other hand,  ^ ' has minimal models. Let M be the structure with dom(M ) = Z
(the integers), (a; b) 2 SuccM , b = a + 1, (a; b) 2<M , a < b in the natural ordering
on the integers, and P M = Z. It can easily be checked that M j=  ^ '. Now suppose
N P M , N 6= M and N j=  ^ '. This means that P N  Z (strict inclusion), and P N 6= ;
(as N j= 9xPx). But then there must be x; y 2 Z with y = x + 1, and either x 2 P N and
y 2= P N , or x 2= P N and y 2 P N , contradicting either N j= 8xy(Px ^ Succ(x; y) ! Py)
(N j= ) or N j= '. Therefore M is a minimal model of  ^ '.
Now dene  = 9x(x 6= x), which is trivially upward persistent. Since  has no minimal
PC
models, we have  j=PC
P  , but M 6j=  , so  ^ ' 6j=P  . This shows that  is not
conservative.
For domain circumscription, the example is quite similar. Again take  = 9x(x 6= x).
Now dene the formulae  and ' as follows:
 = 8x9!y(Succ(x; y))^
' = 8y9x(Succ(x; y))
8xy (Succ(x; y ) ! x < y )^
8xyz (x < y ^ y < z ! x < z )^
8x(:(x < x))^
8xy (x < y _ y < x _ x = y )^
8xyz (Succ(x; z ) ^ Succ(y; z ) ! x = y )
One can now check that  has no d -minimal models, but  ^ ' does, so the same  is
upward persistent but not conservative in domain circumscription. The details are left to
the reader.
2
Until now, we have looked at formulae which, once concluded, are never lost, regardless
of what new information comes in, but also regardless of what the initial premise was.
16

Monotonicity and Persistence in Preferential Logics

However, we can also consider the situation with the premise xed (analogously to the last
part of the previous section): given a premise, which conclusions may be kept regardless of
new information?

Proposition 36 For a preferential logic that satises expressibility of preference, if
 j=  , then
(8' :  ^ ' j=  ) ,  j= :
Proof: Suppose  j=  .
\(" If  j=  then for any ' we have  ^ ' j=  so  ^ ' j=  .

\)" Suppose  6j=  , then there exists m 2 Mod such that m j=  but m 6j=  . Then
m j=  ^ 'm (!), so  ^ 'm 6j=  .
2
Note that the condition  j=  was not used in the proof; if  6j=  the equivalence is
still true, as both sides are false. The proposition shows that the monotonic consequences
of a premise are the only ones conservative with respect to this xed premise.

Corollary 37 Let  be a conservative formula for a preferential logic that satises expressibility of preference, then  j=  ,  j=  .
Proof: If  j=  then in any preferential logic it follows that  j=  . On the other hand, if
 j=  , then for any ' we have  ^ ' j=  , since  is conservative. With Proposition 36
2

it follows that  j=  .

In the last two sections, we have derived a number of results on formulae that respect
monotonicity and conservative formulae and the links with persistent formulae. In the next
section we will discuss the impact of these results in practice.

5. Practical Implications

The results in this paper may improve the eciency of theorem provers for preferential
logics, depending on a number of factors. In the rst place, it is important how the theorem
prover is used.
Consider the situation where we have a stand-alone theorem prover which gets dierent
(unrelated) queries. Furthermore, suppose the theorem prover is asked to prove 1 ^ : : : ^
n j=  . Then there are at least two possibilities for using the results in the paper.
First of all, suppose the preferential logic satises expressibility of preference. Then if 
is upward persistent, we do not have to prove 1 ^ : : : ^ n j=  , as it is equivalent to
prove 1 ^ : : : ^ n j=  (Corollary 37). In most preferential logics, preferential entailment
is harder to compute than entailment in the underlying logic.
In the second place, sometimes local reasoning is possible (which is not possible in general
for non-monotonic logics): the theorem prover may derive the conclusion from part of the
premise. So it may be the case that there is a 1  k < n such that 1 ^ : : : ^ k j=  which
is easier to verify than the original query. Then if k+1 ; : : : ; n are downward persistent,
Proposition 14 implies that 1 ^: : :^n j=  . If  is upward persistent (and the preferential
logic is smooth), Proposition 29 sanctions 1 ^ : : : ^ n j=  . For these results to be usable
17

Engelfriet

in a theorem prover, we need heuristic knowledge to decide if there is a promising split of
the premise into two parts A and B . For such a split, we can then try to prove A j= 
and downward persistence of B or upward persistence of  . In case 1 ^ : : : ^ k j=  can
not be proved, we may have to directly prove 1 ^ : : : ^ n j=  after all.
These two methods will of course only improve eciency if the determination of persistence is easier than the original query (we will treat this question below).
The second kind of situation is when we have a theorem prover which is used by an
agent which has a lot of knowledge about the world, and from time to time performs
observations to increase its knowledge. Then, although sometimes the agent will need to
perform revisions, we are often in the situation that (many) conclusions from a premise
() have been proved, and the premise is augmented by a new formula ('). If this new
formula is downward persistent, then the agent can retain all the old conclusions (and may
only need to derive some new conclusions). If it is not, it can at least retain all the upward
persistent conclusions (if the preferential logic is smooth). We may also try to determine
if ' is downward persistent given , or if  is conservative given . Again, these methods
only improve eciency if it is easier to determine if ' respects monotonicity (possibly given
) than recomputing all old conclusions, or if it is easier to determine that  is conservative
(possibly given ) than checking  ^ ' j=  .
The possible eciency improvement in both cases heavily depends on the cost of determining persistence relative to the cost of determining preferential consequence. Unfortunately, it is very hard to say anything about this issue in general. It depends on the
preferential logic at hand, on the representation of the logic (syntactically, as a proof calculus, or semantically, as models with a preference relation), and on other implementation
issues. For instance, it can be important how much information is retained from previous
queries: whether proofs or minimal models are stored. Let us consider the examples again.
Preferential entailment in both Ground S5 and MTEL is QP3 -complete (Engelfriet,
1996a), whereas full circumscription is undecidable (restricted versions of circumscription
exist which are decidable, but still highly complex). Unfortunately, determining downward
or upward persistence is not easier for these logics. We have seen that the classes of persistent formulae have syntactic representations of the form: ' is upward/downward persistent
if and only if it is equivalent to a formula in C , where C is a (syntactic) class of formulae.
Now, of course, determining equivalence to a formula in C is as complex as determining
persistence, but there may be subclasses of a class of persistent formulae, with a lower
complexity. For instance, determining membership of C is much easier, namely polynomial.
The members of C are persistent. So what we propose is to check membership of C , instead
of equivalence to a member of C . In that case, we will miss some persistent formulae (and
have to prove the original query), but this disadvantage is outweighed by the complexity
advantage of checking membership. The checking of membership can be improved upon by
adding some (easy) checks for equivalence to a formula in C . For instance, in Ground S5,
if we consider, for a formula ', for each propositional sub-formula, the nearest K operator
in which scope it lies, then if all of these K operators are in the scope of an odd number of
negations, we can conclude that ' is downward persistent. The formula :K (q _ Kp), for
example, satises this condition, and although it is not a member of DIAM, it is equivalent
to :Kq ^ :Kp 2 DIAM. This check is obviously polynomial.
18

Monotonicity and Persistence in Preferential Logics

Given a preferential logic, the designer of a theorem prover could proceed as follows.
First, syntactic classes of formulae that are downward and upward persistent have to be
identied. For Ground S5, MTEL and predicate and domain circumscription, these can be
found in Denitions 15, 17, 19 and Proposition 32. For other preferential logics, if such
classes are trivial (they may, for instance, only include tautologies and contradictions),
then the usefulness of the results is limited. Otherwise, the theorem prover could work
as follows. Given a query of the form  ^ ' j=  , rst it is checked if ' belongs to the
syntactic class of downward persistent formulae or if  belongs to the syntactic class of
upward persistent formulae (this latter test should only be performed if the preferential
logic is smooth). If  is conservative and the logic satises expressibility of preference, it
tries to prove  ^ ' j=  (this usually has a lower complexity than the original query; for
Ground S5 and MTEL, monotonic consequence is NP-complete, Engelfriet, 1996a). The
answer of this query is the answer to the original query (see Corollary 37). Otherwise, if
' belongs to the syntactic class of downward persistent formulae or if  belongs to the
syntactic class of upward persistent formulae (but the logic does not satisfy expressibility
of preference), then the theorem prover tries to prove  j=  . If this succeeds, it outputs
yes. Otherwise, it will try to answer the original query directly.
As stated before, the practical savings in part depend on representation and implementation aspects. It also depends on the application domain and use of the theorem prover:
if formulae in these syntactic classes occur often, the eciency improvement is higher than
if they are infrequent.

6. Conclusions and Further Research
We have looked at restrictions of monotonicity in preferential logics. While monotonicity
does not hold in general, we can identify (in general non-trivial) classes of formulae for
which restricted versions of monotonicity holds. This may make (nonmonotonic) deduction
in preferential logics easier, since we may sometimes keep conclusions, or identify which
conclusions may be kept, when adding new information to a premise. The results in this
paper may lead to more ecient implementations of preferential logics. Experimenting with
theorem provers which use these results is necessary in order to determine the eciency
improvement in practice.
It would be nice to nd a better characterization of formulae that can be added to a
given, xed premise without destroying conclusions.
Syntactic characterizations of persistent formulae were given for a number of example
preferential logics, but we would like to have a result for broader classes of preferential

Abstract

This paper introduces new algorithms and data structures for quick counting for machine
learning datasets. We focus on the counting task of constructing contingency tables, but
our approach is also applicable to counting the number of records in a dataset that match
conjunctive queries. Subject to certain assumptions, the costs of these operations can be
shown to be independent of the number of records in the dataset and loglinear in the
number of non-zero entries in the contingency table.
We provide a very sparse data structure, the ADtree, to minimize memory use. We
provide analytical worst-case bounds for this structure for several models of data distribution. We empirically demonstrate that tractably-sized data structures can be produced for
large real-world datasets by (a) using a sparse tree structure that never allocates memory
for counts of zero, (b) never allocating memory for counts that can be deduced from other
counts, and (c) not bothering to expand the tree fully near its leaves.
We show how the ADtree can be used to accelerate Bayes net structure nding algorithms, rule learning algorithms, and feature selection algorithms, and we provide a
number of empirical results comparing ADtree methods against traditional direct counting
approaches. We also discuss the possible uses of ADtrees in other machine learning methods, and discuss the merits of ADtrees in comparison with alternative representations such
as kd-trees, R-trees and Frequent Sets.

1. Caching Sucient Statistics

Computational eciency is an important concern for machine learning algorithms, especially
when applied to large datasets (Fayyad, Mannila, & Piatetsky-Shapiro, 1997; Fayyad &
Uthurusamy, 1996) or in real-time scenarios. In earlier work we showed how kd-trees with
multiresolution cached regression matrix statistics can enable very fast locally weighted
and instance based regression (Moore, Schneider, & Deng, 1997). In this paper, we attempt
to accelerate predictions for symbolic attributes using a kind of kd-tree that splits on all
dimensions at all nodes.
Many machine learning algorithms operating on datasets of symbolic attributes need to
do frequent counting. This work is also applicable to Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)
applications in data mining, where operations on large datasets such as multidimensional
database access, DataCube operations (Harinarayan, Rajaraman, & Ullman, 1996), and
association rule learning (Agrawal, Mannila, Srikant, Toivonen, & Verkamo, 1996) could be
accelerated by fast counting.
Let us begin by establishing some notation. We are given a data set with R records
and M attributes. The attributes are called a1; a2; : : : aM . The value of attribute ai in the

M = 3 attributes.

1.1 Queries

A query is a set of (attribute = value) pairs in which the left hand sides of the pairs form
a subset of fa1 : : : aM g arranged in increasing order of index. Four examples of queries for
our dataset are
(a1 = 1); (a2 = 3; a3 = 1); (); (a1 = 2; a2 = 4; a3 = 2)

(1)

Notice that the total number of possible queries is M
i=1 (ni + 1). This is because each
attribute can either appear in the query with one of the ni values it may take, or it may be
omitted (which is equivalent to giving it a ai = * \don't care" value).

1.2 Counts

The count of a query, denoted by C (Query) is simply the number of records in the dataset
matching all the (attribute = value) pairs in Query. For our example dataset we nd:
( 1 = 1)
C (a2 = 3; a3 = 1)
C ()
C (a1 = 2; a2 = 4; a3 = 2)
C a

Each subset of attributes, ai(1) : : : ai(n) , has an associated contingency table denoted by
ct(ai(1) : : : ai(n)). This is a table with a row for each of the possible sets of values for
ai(1) : : : ai(n) . The row corresponding to ai(1) = v1 : : : ai(n) = vn records the count C (ai(1) =
3
v1 : : : ai(n) = vn ). Our example dataset has 3 attributes and so 2 = 8 contingency tables
exist, depicted in Figure 2.

Contingency tables are used in a variety of machine learning applications, including
building the probability tables for Bayes nets and evaluating candidate conjunctive rules in
rule learning algorithms (Quinlan, 1990; Clark & Niblett, 1989). It would thus be desirable
to be able to perform such counting eciently.
If we are prepared to pay a one-time cost for building a caching data structure, then it is
easy to suggest a mechanism for doing counting in constant time. For each possible query,
we precompute the contingency table. The total amount of numbers stored in memory for
such a data structure would be M
i=1 (ni + 1), which even for our humble dataset of Figure 1
is 45, as revealed by Figure 2. For a real dataset with more than ten attributes of medium
arity, or fteen binary attributes, this is far too large to t in main memory.
We would like to retain the speed of precomputed contingency tables without incurring
an intractable memory demand. That is the subject of this paper.

2. Cache Reduction 1: The Dense ADtree for Caching Sucient Statistics

First we will describe the ADtree, the data structure we will use to represent the set of
all possible counts. Our initial simplied description is an obvious tree representation that
does not yield any immediate memory savings,1 but will later provide several opportunities
1. The SE-tree (Rymon, 1993) is a similar data structure.

69

Moore & Lee

for cutting o zero counts and redundant counts. This structure is shown in Figure 3. An
ADtree node (shown as a rectangle) has child nodes called \Vary nodes" (shown as ovals).
Each ADnode represents a query and stores the number of records that match the query (in
the C = # eld). The Vary aj child of an ADnode has one child for each of the nj values
of attribute aj . The kth such child represents the same query as Vary aj 's parent, with the
additional constraint that aj = k.

Notes regarding this structure:

 Although drawn on the diagram, the description of the query (e.g.,

= 1; a2 =
*; ::aM = * on the leftmost ADnode of the second level) is not explicitly recorded in
the ADnode. The contents of an ADnode are simply a count and a set of pointers to
the Vary aj children.
The contents of a Vary aj node are a set of pointers to ADnodes.

a

 The cost of looking up a count is proportional to the number of instantiated variables

in the query. For example, to look up C (a7 = 2; a13 = 1; a22 = 3) we would follow the
following path in the tree: Vary a7 ! a7 = 2 ! Vary a13 ! a13 = 1 ! Vary a22 !
a22 = 3. Then the count is obtained from the resulting node.

 Notice that if a node ADN has Vary
Vary ai+1 Vary

ai

+2

ai

as its parent, then ADN's children are

... Vary aM .

It is not necessary to store Vary nodes with indices below i+1 because that information
can be obtained from another path in the tree.

Cached Sufficient Statistics for Efficient Machine Learning

2.1 Cutting o nodes with counts of zero

As described, the tree is not sparse and will contain exactly M
i=1 (ni + 1) nodes. Sparseness
is easily achieved by storing a NULL instead of a node for any query that matches zero
records. All of the specializations of such a query will also have a count of zero and they
will not appear anywhere in the tree. For some datasets this can reduce the number of
numbers that need to be stored. For example, the dataset in Figure 1, which previously
needed 45 numbers to represent all contingency tables, will now only need 22 numbers.

3. Cache Reduction II: The Sparse ADtree

It is easy to devise datasets for which there is no benet in failing to store counts of zero.
Suppose we have M binary attributes and 2M records in which the kth record is the bits of
the binary representation of k. Then no query has a count of zero and the tree contains 3M
nodes. To reduce the tree size despite this, we will take advantage of the observation that
very many of the counts stored in the above tree are redundant.
Each Vary aj node in the above ADtree stores nj subtrees|one subtree for each value
of aj . Instead, we will nd the most common of the values of aj (call it MCV) and store a
NULL in place of the MCVth subtree. The remaining nj , 1 subtrees will be represented
as before. An example for a simple dataset is given in Figure 4. Each Vary aj node now
records which of its values is most common in a MCV eld. Appendix B describes the
straightforward algorithm for building such an ADtree.
As we will see in Section 4, it is still possible to build full exact contingency tables (or
give counts for specic queries) in time that is only slightly longer than for the full ADtree
of Section 2. But rst let us examine the memory consequences of this representation.
Appendix A shows that for binary attributes, given M attributes and R records, the
number of nodes needed to store the tree is bounded above by 2M in the worst case (and
much less if R < 2M ). In contrast, the amount of memory needed by the dense tree of
Section 2 is 3M in the worst case.
Notice in Figure 4 that the MCV value is context dependent. Depending on constraints
on parent nodes, a2's MCV is sometimes 1 and sometimes 2. This context dependency
can provide dramatic savings if (as is frequently the case) there are correlations among the
attributes. This is discussed further in Appendix A.

4. Computing Contingency Tables from the Sparse ADtree

Given an ADtree, we wish to be able to quickly construct contingency tables for any arbitrary set of attributes fai(1) : : : ai(n) g.
Notice that a conditional contingency table ct(ai(1) : : : ai(n) j Query) can be built recursively. We rst build

ct(
ct(

(2) : : : ai(n) j ai(1) = 1; Query)
ai(2) : : : ai(n) j ai(1) = 2; Query)

right. The most common value for a1 is 3, and so the a1 = 3 subtree
of the Vary a1 child of the root node is NULL. At each of the Vary a2
nodes the most common child is also set to NULL (which child is most
common depends on the context).
For example, to build ct(a1; a3) using the dataset in Figure 1, we can build ct(a3 j a1 = 1)
and ct(a3 j a1 = 2) and combine them as in Figure 5.

When building a conditional contingency table from an ADtree, we will not need to
explicitly specify the query condition. Instead, we will supply an ADnode of the ADtree,
which implicitly is equivalent information. The algorithm is:

Let VN := The Vary ai(1) subnode of ADN.
Let MCV := VN:MCV.

Let ADNk := The ai(1) = k subnode of VN.

The base case of this recursion occurs when the rst argument is empty, in which case we
return a one-element contingency table containing the count associated with the current
ADnode, ADN.
There is an omission in the algorithm. In the iteration over k 2 f1; 2; : : : ni(1)g we are
unable to compute the conditional contingency table for CTMCV because the ai(1) = MCV
subtree is deliberately missing as per Section 3. What can we do instead?
We can take advantage of the following property of contingency tables:

ct(

ai

(2) : : : ai(n) j Query) =

X

ni(1)

ct(

(2) : : : ai(n)

ai

k=1

j

(1) = k; Query)

ai

(3)

The value ct(ai(2) : : : ai(n) j Query) can be computed from within our algorithm by calling

MakeContab(f

(2) : : : ai(n) g; ADN)

(4)

ai

and so the missing conditional contingency table in the algorithm can be computed by the
following row-wise subtraction:
X
CTMCV := MakeContab(fai(2) : : : ai(n) g; ADN) ,
CTk
(5)
k6=M CV

Frequent Sets (Agrawal et al., 1996), which are traditionally used for learning association
rules, can also be used for computing counts. A recent paper (Mannila & Toivonen, 1996),
which also employs a similar subtraction trick, calculates counts from Frequent Sets. In
Section 8 we will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of Frequent Sets in comparison with
ADtrees.

4.1 Complexity of building a contingency table

What is the cost of computing a contingency table? Let us consider the theoretical worstcase cost of computing a contingency table for n attributes each of arity k|note that this
cost is unrealistically pessimistic (except when k = 2), because most contingency tables are
sparse, as discussed later. The assumption that all attributes have the same arity, k, is
made to simplify the calculation of the worst-case cost, but is not needed by the code.
73

Moore & Lee

A contingency table for n attributes has kn entries. Write C (n) = the cost of computing
such a contingency table. In the top-level call of MakeContab there are k calls to build
contingency tables from n , 1 attributes: k , 1 of these calls are to build CT(ai(2) : : : ai(n) j
ai(1) = j; Query) for every j in f1; 2; : : : k g except the MCV, and the nal call is to build
CT(ai(2) : : : ai(n) j Query). Then there will be k , 1 subtractions of contingency tables,
which will each require kn,1 numeric subtractions. So we have
C (0)
= 1
(6)
n,1
C (n)
= kC (n , 1) + (k , 1)k
if n > 0
(7)
The solution to this recurrence relation is C (n) = (1 + n(k , 1))kn,1 ; this cost is loglinear
in the size of the contingency table. By comparison, if we used no cached data structure,
but simply counted through the dataset in order to build a contingency table we would
need O(nR + kn ) operations where R is the number of records in the dataset. We are thus
cheaper than the standard counting method if kn  R. We are interested in large datasets
in which R may be more than 100; 000. In such a case our method will present a several
order of magnitude speedup for, say, a contingency table of eight binary attributes. Notice
that this cost is independent of M, the total number of attributes in the dataset, and
only depends upon the (almost always much smaller) number of attributes n requested for
the contingency table.

4.2 Sparse representation of contingency tables

In practice, we do not represent contingency tables as multidimensional arrays, but rather
as tree structures. This gives both the slow counting approach and the ADtree approach
a substantial computational advantage in cases where the contingency table is sparse, i.e.
has many zero entries. Figure 6 shows such a sparse contingency table representation. This
can mean average-case behavior is much faster than worst case for contingency tables with
large numbers of attributes or high-arity attributes.
Indeed, our experiments in Section 7 show costs rising much more slowly than O(nkn,1 )
as n increases. Note too that when using a sparse representation, the worst-case for
MakeContab is now O(min(nR; nkn,1)) because R is the maximum possible number of
non-zero contingency table entries.

5. Cache Reduction III: Leaf-Lists

We now introduce a scheme for further reducing memory use. It is not worth building
the ADtree data structure for a small number of records. For example, suppose we have
15 records and 40 binary attributes. Then the analysis in Appendix A shows us that in
the worst case the ADtree might require 10701 nodes. But computing contingency tables
using the resulting ADtree would, with so few records, be no faster than the conventional
counting approach, which would merely require us to retain the dataset in memory.
Aside from concluding that ADtrees are not useful for very small datasets, this also
leads to a nal method for saving memory in large ADtrees. Any ADtree node with fewer
than Rmin records does not expand its subtree. Instead it maintains a list of pointers into
the original dataset, explicitly listing those records that match the current ADnode. Such
a list of pointers is called a leaf-list. Figure 7 gives an example.

Figure 6: The right hand gure is the sparse representation of the contingency table on the left.
The use of leaf-lists has one minor and two major consequences. The minor consequence is the need to include a straightforward change in the contingency table generating
algorithm to handle leaf-list nodes. This minor alteration is not described here. The rst
major consequence is that now the dataset itself must be retained in main memory so that
algorithms that inspect leaf-lists can access the rows of data pointed to in those leaf-lists.
The second major consequence is that the ADtree may require much less memory. This is
documented in Section 7 and worst-case bounds are provided in Appendix A.

6. Using ADtrees for Machine Learning
As we will see in Section 7, the ADtree structure can substantially speed up the computation
of contingency tables for large real datasets. How can machine learning and statistical
algorithms take advantage of this? Here we provide three examples: Feature Selection,
Bayes net scoring and rule learning. But it seems likely that many other algorithms can
also benet, for example stepwise logistic regression, GMDH (Madala & Ivakhnenko, 1994),
and text classication. Even decision tree (Quinlan, 1983; Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, &
Stone, 1984) learning may benet. 2 In future work we will also examine ways to speed up
nearest neighbor and other memory-based queries using ADtrees.
2. This depends on whether the cost of initially building the ADtree can be amortized over many runs of
the decision tree algorithm. Repeated runs of decision tree building can occur if one is using the wrapper
model of feature selection (John, Kohavi, & Peger, 1994), or if one is using a more intensive search over
tree structures than the traditional greedy search (Quinlan, 1983; Breiman et al., 1984)

6.1 Datasets

The experiments used the datasets in Table 1. Each dataset was supplied to us with all
continuous attributes already discretized into ranges.

6.2 Using ADtrees for Feature Selection

Given M attributes, of which one is an output that we wish to predict, it is often interesting
to ask \which subset of n attributes, (n < M ), is the best predictor of the output on the
same distribution of datapoints that are reected in this dataset?" (Kohavi, 1995). There
are many ways of scoring a set of features, but a particularly simple one is information
gain (Cover & Thomas, 1991).
Let aout be the attribute we wish to predict and let ai(1) : : : ai(n) be the set of attributes
used as inputs. Let X be the set of possible assignments of values to ai(1) : : : ai(n) and write
Assignk 2 X as the kth such assignment. Then

The counts needed in the above computation can be read directly from ct(aout ; ai(1) : : : ai(n) ).
Searching for the best subset of attributes is simply a question of search among all
attribute-sets of size n (n specied by the user). This is a simple example designed to test

our counting methods: any practical feature selector would need to penalize the number of
rows in the contingency table (else high arity attributes would tend to win).

6.3 Using ADtrees for Bayes Net Structure Discovery

There are many possible Bayes net learning tasks, all of which entail counting, and hence
might be speeded up by ADtrees. In this paper we present experimental results for the
particular example of scoring the structure of a Bayes net to decide how well it matches the
data.
We will use maximum likelihood scoring with a penalty for the number of parameters.
We rst compute the probability table associated with each node. Write Parents(j) for the
parent attributes of node j and write Xj as the set of possible assignments of values to
Parents(j). The maximum likelihood estimate for
( = v j Xj )

P aj

is estimated as

(10)

( = v; Xj )
(11)
C (Xj )
and all such estimates for node j 's probability tables can be read from ct(aj ; Parents(j)).
The next step in scoring a structure is to decide the likelihood of the data given the
probability tables we computed and to penalize the number of parameters in our network
(without the penalty the likelihood would increase every time a link was added to the
C aj

Figure 8: A Bayes net that generated our SYNTH datasets. There are
three kinds of nodes. The nodes marked with triangles are generated with
P (ai = 1) = 0:8; P (ai = 2) = 0:2. The square nodes are deterministic.
A square node takes value 2 if the sum of its four parents is even, else it
takes value 1. The circle nodes are probabilistic functions of their single
parent, dened by P (ai = 2 j Parent = 1) = 0 and P (ai = 2 j Parent =
2) = 0:4. This provides a dataset with fairly sparse values and with many
interdependencies.

We search among structures to nd the best score. In these experiments we use randomrestart stochastic hill climbing in which the operations are random addition or removal of
a network link or randomly swapping a pair of nodes. The latter operation is necessary to
allow the search algorithm to choose the best ordering of nodes in the Bayes net. Stochastic
searches such as this are a popular method for nding Bayes net structures (Friedman &
Yakhini, 1996). Only the probability tables of the aected nodes are recomputed on each
step.
Figure 9 shows the Bayes net structure returned by our Bayes net structure nder after
30,000 iterations of hill climbing.

To avoid rules without signicant support, we also insist that C (Assign) (the number of
records matching the query) must be above some threshold Smin.
In these experiments we implement a brute force search that looks through all possible
queries that involve a user-specied number of attributes, n. We build each ct(aout ; ai(1) : : : ai(n) )
in turn (there are M choose n such tables), and then look through the rows of each table
for all queries using the ai(1) : : : ai(n) that have greater than minimum support Smin. We
return a priority queue of the highest scoring rules. For instance on the ADULT2 dataset,
the best rule for predicting \class" from 4 attributes was:
score = 0.965 (218/226), workclass = Private, education-num = above12, maritalstatus = Married-civ-spouse, capital-loss = above1600 ) class  50k

7. Experimental Results
Let us rst examine the memory required by an ADtree on our datasets. Table 2 shows us,
for example, that the ADULT2 dataset produced an ADtree with 95,000 nodes. The tree
required almost 11 megabytes of memory. Among the three ADULT datasets, the size of
the tree varied approximately linearly with the number of records.
Unless otherwise specied, in all the experiments in this section, the ADULT datasets
used no leaf-lists. The BIRTH and SYNTHETIC datasets used leaf-lists of size Rmin = 16 by
default. The BIRTH dataset, with its large number of sparse attributes, required a modest
8 megabytes to store the tree|many magnitudes below the worst-case bounds. Among the
synthetic datasets, the tree size increased sublinearly with the dataset size. This indicates

that as the dataset gets larger, novel records (which may cause new nodes to appear in the
tree) become less frequent.
Table 3 shows the costs of performing 30,000 iterations of Bayes net structure searching.
All experiments were performed on a 200Mhz Pentium Pro machine with 192 megabytes
of main memory. Recall that each Bayes net iteration involves one random change to the
network and so requires recomputation of one contingency table (the exception is the rst
iteration, in which all nodes must be computed). This means that the time to run 30,000
iterations is essentially the time to compute 30,000 contingency tables. Among the ADULT
datasets, the advantage of the ADtree over conventional counting ranges between a factor
of 19 to 32. Unsurprisingly, the computational costs for ADULT increase sublinearly with
dataset size for the ADtree but linearly for the conventional counting. The computational
advantages and the sublinear behavior are much more pronounced for the synthetic data.
Next, Table 4 examines the eect of leaf-lists on the ADULT2 and BIRTH datasets. For
the ADULT dataset, the byte size of the tree decreases by a factor of 5 when leaf-lists are
increased from 1 to 64. But the computational cost of running the Bayes search increases
by only 25%, indicating a worth-while tradeo if memory is scarce.
The Bayes net scoring results involved the average cost of computing contingency tables
of many dierent sizes. The following results in Tables 5 and 6 make the savings for xed
size attribute sets easier to discern. These tables give results for the feature selection and
rule nding algorithms, respectively. The biggest savings come from small attribute sets.
Computational savings for sets of size one or two are, however, not particularly interesting
since all such counts could be cached by straightforward methods without needing any tricks.
In all cases, however, we do see large savings, especially for the BIRTH data. Datasets with
larger numbers of rows would, of course, reveal larger savings.

searching for the best Bayes net structure. ADtree Time is the time
when using the ADtree and Regular Time is the time taken when using
the conventional probability table scoring method of counting through
the dataset. Speedup Factor is the number of times by which the ADtree
method is faster than the conventional method. The ADtree times do
not include the time for building the ADtree in the rst place (given in
Table 2). A typical use of ADtrees will build the tree only once and then
be able to use it for many data analysis operations, and so its building
cost can be amortized. In any case, even including tree building cost
would have only a minor impact on the results.

8. Alternative Data Structures
8.1 Why not use a kd-tree?
kd-trees can be used for accelerating learning algorithms (Omohundro, 1987; Moore et al.,
1997). The primary dierence is that a kd-tree node splits on only one attribute instead
of all attributes. This results in much less memory (linear in the number of records). But
counting can be expensive. Suppose, for example, that level one of the tree splits on a1 , level
two splits on a2, etc. Then, in the case of binary variables, if we have a query involving only
attributes a20 and higher, we have to explore all paths in the tree down to level 20. With
datasets of fewer than 220 records this may be no cheaper than performing a linear search
through the records. Another possibility, R-trees (Guttman, 1984; Roussopoulos & Leifker,
1985), store databases of M -dimensional geometric objects. However, in this context, they
oer no advantages over kd-trees.

8.2 Why not use a Frequent Set nder?
Frequent Set nders (Agrawal et al., 1996) are typically used with very large databases
of millions of records containing very sparse binary attributes. Ecient algorithms exist
for nding all subsets of attributes that co-occur with value TRUE in more than a xed
number (chosen by the user, and called the support) of records. Recent research(Mannila &
Toivonen, 1996) suggests that such Frequent Sets can be used to perform ecient counting.
In the case where support = 1, all such Frequent Sets are gathered and, if counts of each
Frequent Set are retained, this is equivalent to producing an ADtree in which instead of
performing a node cuto for the most common value, the cuto always occurs for value
FALSE.
The use of Frequent Sets in this way would thus be very similar to the use of ADtrees,
with one advantage and one disadvantage. The advantage is that ecient algorithms have
been developed for building Frequent Sets from a small number of sequential passes through
data. The ADtree requires random access to the dataset while it is being built, and for its
leaf-lists. This is impractical if the dataset is too large to reside in main memory and is
accessed through database queries.
The disadvantage of Frequent Sets in comparison with ADtrees is that, under some
circumstances, the former may require much more memory. Assume the value 2 is rarer
than 1 throughout all attributes in the dataset and assume reasonably that we thus choose
to nd all Frequent Sets of 2s. Unnecessarily many sets will be produced if there are
correlations. In the extreme case, imagine a dataset in which 30% of the values are 2, 70%
are 1 and attributes are perfectly correlated|all values in each record are identical. Then,
with M attributes there would be 2M Frequent Sets of 2s. In contrast, the ADtree would
only contain M + 1 nodes. This is an extreme example, but datasets with much weaker
inter-attribute correlations can similarly benet from using an ADtree.
Leaf-lists are another technique to reduce the size of ADtrees further. They could also
be used for the Frequent Set representation.
83

Moore & Lee

8.3 Why not use hash tables?

If we knew that only a small set of contingency tables would ever be requested, instead of
all possible contingency tables, then an ADtree would be unnecessary. It would be better to
remember this small set of contingency tables explicitly. Then, some kind of tree structure
could be used to index the contingency tables. But a hash table would be equally time
ecient and require less space. A hash table coding of individual counts in the contingency
tables would similarly allow us to use space proportional only to the number of non-zero
entries in the stored tables. But for representing sucient statistics to permit fast solution
to any contingency table request, the ADtree structure remains more memory ecient than
the hash-table approach (or any method that stores all non-zero counts) because of the
memory reductions when we exploit the ignoring of most common values.

9. Discussion

9.1 What about numeric attributes?

The ADtree representation is designed entirely for symbolic attributes. When faced with
numeric attributes, the simplest solution is to discretize them into a xed nite set of values
which are then treated as symbols, but this is of little help if the user requests counts for
queries involving inequalities on numeric attributes. In future work we will evaluate the use
of structures combining elements from multiresolution kd-trees of real attributes (Moore
et al., 1997) with ADtrees.

9.2 Algorithm-specic counting tricks

Many algorithms that count using the conventional \linear" method have algorithm-specic
ways of accelerating their performance. For example, a Bayes net structure nder may try
to remember all the contingency tables it has tried previously in case it needs to re-evaluate
them. When it deletes a link, it can deduce the new contingency table from the old one
without needing a linear count.
In such cases, the most appropriate use of the ADtree may be as a lazy caching mechanism. At birth, the ADtree consists only of the root node. Whenever the structure nder
needs a contingency table that cannot be deduced from the current ADtree structure, the
appropriate nodes of the ADtree are expanded. The ADtree then takes on the role of the
algorithm-specic caching methods, while (in general) using up much less memory than if
all contingency tables were remembered.

9.3 Hard to update incrementally

Although the tree can be built cheaply (see the experimental results in Section 7), and
although it can be built lazily, the ADtree cannot be updated cheaply with a new record.
This is because one new record may match up to 2M nodes in the tree in the worst case.

9.4 Scaling up

The ADtree representation can be useful for datasets of the rough size and shape used in this
paper. On the rst datasets we have looked at|the ones described in this paper|we have
84

Cached Sufficient Statistics for Efficient Machine Learning

shown empirically that the sizes of the ADtrees are tractable given real noisy data. This
included one dataset with 97 attributes. It is the extent to which the attributes are skewed
in their values and correlated with each other that enables the ADtree to avoid approaching
its worse-case bounds. The main technical contribution of this paper is the trick that allows
us to prune o most-common-values. Without it, skewedness and correlation would hardly
help at all. 3 The empirical contribution of this paper has been to show that the actual
sizes of the ADtrees produced from real data are vastly smaller than the sizes we would get
from the worst-case bounds in Appendix A.
But despite these savings, ADtrees cannot yet represent all the sucient statistics for
huge datasets with many hundreds of non-sparse and poorly correlated attributes. What
should we do if our dataset or our ADtree cannot t into main memory? In the latter case,
we could simply increase the size of leaf-lists, trading o decreased memory against increased
time to build contingency tables. But if that is inadequate at least three possibilities remain.
First, we could build approximate ADtrees that do not store any information for nodes
that match fewer than a threshold number of records. Then approximate contingency
tables (complete with error bounds) can be produced (Mannila & Toivonen, 1996). A
second possibility is to exploit secondary storage and store deep, rarely visited nodes of the
ADtree on disk. This would doubtless best be achieved by integrating the machine learning
algorithms with current database management tools|a topic of considerable interest in the
data mining community (Fayyad et al., 1997). A third possibility, which restricts the size
of contingency tables we may ask for, is to refuse to store counts for queries with more than
some threshold number of attributes.

9.5 What about the cost of building the tree?
In practice, ADtrees could be used in two ways:

 One-o. When a traditional algorithm is required we build the ADtree, run the fast
version of the algorithm, discard the ADtree, and return the results.

 Amortized. When a new dataset becomes available, a new ADtree is built for it.

The tree is then shipped and re-used by anyone who wishes to do real-time counting
queries, multivariate graphs and charts, or any machine learning algorithms on any
subset of the attributes. The cost of the initial tree building is then amortized over
all the times it is used. In database terminology, the process is known as materializing (Harinarayan et al., 1996) and has been suggested as desirable for datamining by
several researchers (John & Lent, 1997; Mannila & Toivonen, 1996).

The one-o option is only useful if the cost of building the ADtree plus the cost of running
the ADtree-based algorithm is less than the cost of the original counting-based algorithm.
For the intensive machine learning methods studied here, this condition is safely satised.
But what if we decided to use a less intensive, greedier Bayes net structure nder? Table 7
3. Without pruning, on all of our datasets we ran out of memory on a 192 megabyte machine before we
had built even 1% of the tree, and it is easy to show that the BIRTH dataset would have needed to store
more than 1030 nodes.

Table 7: Computational economics of building ADtrees and using them
to search for Bayes net structures using the experiments of Section 7.
shows that if we only run for 300 iterations instead of 30,0004 and if we account for a one-o
ADtree building cost, then the relative speedup of using ADtrees declines greatly.
To conclude: if the data analysis is intense then there is benet to using ADtrees even
if they are used in a one-o fashion. If the ADtree is used for multiple purposes then its
build-time is amortized and the resulting relative eciency gains over traditional counting
are the same for both exhaustive searches and non-exhaustive searches. Algorithms that
use non-exhaustive searches include hill-climbing Bayes net learners, greedy rule learners
such as CN2 (Clark & Niblett, 1989) and decision tree learners (Quinlan, 1983; Breiman
et al., 1984).

Appendix A: Memory Costs

In this appendix we examine the size of the tree. For simplicity, we restrict attention to the
case of binary attributes.

The worst-case number of nodes in an ADtree
Given a dataset with M attributes and R records, the worst-case for the ADtree will occur if
all 2M possible records exist in the dataset. Then, for every subset of attributes there exists
exactly one node in the ADtree. For example consider the attribute set fai(1) : : : ai(n) g,
where i(1) < i(2) < ::: < i(n). Suppose there is a node in the tree corresponding to the
4. Unsurprisingly, the resulting Bayes nets have a highly inferior structure.

86

Cached Sufficient Statistics for Efficient Machine Learning

query fai(1) = v1 : : : ai(n) = vn g for some values v1 : : : vn . From the denition of an ADtree,
and remembering we are only considering the case of binary attributes, we can state:
 v1 is the least common value of ai(1).
 v2 is the least common value of ai(2) among those records that match (ai(1) = v1).
..
.



is the least common value of ai(k+1) among those records that match (ai(1) =
1
(k) = vk ).
So there is at most one such node. Moreover, since our worst-case assumption is that
all possible records exist in the database, we see that the ADtree will indeed contain this
node. Thus, the worst-case number of nodes is the same as the number of possible subsets
of attributes: 2M .

v ; : : : ; ai

The worst-case number of nodes in an ADtree with a reasonable number of rows
It is frequently the case that a dataset has  2M . With fewer records, there is a much
R

lower worst-case bound on the ADtree size. A node at the kth level of the tree corresponds
to a query involving k attributes (counting the root node as level 0). Such a node can match
at most R2,k records because each of the node's ancestors up the tree has pruned o at
least half the records by choosing to expand only the least common value of the attribute
introduced by that ancestor. Thus, there can be no tree nodes at level blog2 Rc + 1 of the
tree, because such nodes would have to match fewer than R2,blog Rc,1 < 1 records. They
would thus match no records, making them NULL.
The nodes in an ADtree must all exist at level blog2 Rc or higher. The number of nodes
at level k is at most ( ), because every node at level k involves an attribute set of size
k and because (given binary attributes) for every attribute set there is at most one node
in the ADtree. Thus the total number of nodes in the tree, summing over the levels is less
than

The number of nodes if we assume skewed independent attribute values

Imagine that all values of all attributes in the dataset are independent random binary
variables, taking value 2 with probability p and taking value 1 with probability 1 , p. Then
the further p is from 0:5, the smaller we can expect the ADtree to be. This is because,
on average, the less common value of a Vary node will match fraction min(p; 1 , p) of its
parent's records. And, on average, the number of records matched at the kth level of the
tree will be R(min(p; 1 , p))k . Thus, the maximum level in the tree at which we may
nd a node matching one or more records is approximately b(log2 R)=(, log2 q )c, where
q = min(p; 1 , p). And so the total number of nodes in the tree is approximately

Since the exponent is reduced by a factor of log2 (1=q ), skewedness among the attributes
thus brings enormous savings in memory.

The number of nodes if we assume correlated attribute values

The ADtree benets from correlations among attributes in much the same way that it
benets from skewedness. For example, suppose that each record was generated by the
simple Bayes net in Figure 10, where the random variable B is hidden (not included in the
record). Then for i 6= j , P (ai 6= aj ) = 2p(1 , p). If ADN is any node in the resulting ADtree
then the number of records matching any other node two levels below ADN in the tree will
be fraction 2p(1 , p) of the number of records matching ADN. From this we can see that
the number of nodes in the tree is approximately

The number of nodes for the dense ADtree of Section 2

The dense ADtrees do not cut o the tree for the most common value of a Vary node. The
worst case ADtree will occur if all 2M possible records exist in the dataset. Then the dense
ADtree will require 3M nodes because every possible query (with each attribute taking
values 1, 2 or *) will have a count in the tree. The number of nodes at the kth level of the
dense ADtree can be 2k ( ) in the worst case.

The number of nodes when using Leaf-lists

Leaf-lists were described in Section 5. If a tree is built using maximum leaf-list size of Rmin,
then any node in the ADtree matching fewer than Rmin records is a leaf node. This means
that Formulae 15, 16 and 17 can be re-used, replacing R with R=Rmin. It is important to
remember, however, that the leaf nodes must now contain room for Rmin numbers instead
of a single count.
