<p>We investigate a class of first-order temporal-epistemic logics for reasoning about multi-agent systems. We encode typical properties of systems including perfect recall, synchronicity, no learning, and having a unique initial state in terms of variants of quantified interpreted systems, a first-order extension of interpreted systems. We identify several monodic fragments of first-order temporal-epistemic logic and show their completeness with respect to their corresponding classes of quantified interpreted systems.<br />

<p>The constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a general problem central to computer science and artificial intelligence.  Although the CSP is NP-hard in general, considerable effort has been spent on identifying tractable subclasses.  The main two approaches consider structural properties (restrictions on the hypergraph of constraint scopes) and relational properties (restrictions on the language of constraint relations).  Recently, some authors have considered hybrid properties that restrict the constraint hypergraph and the relations simultaneously.<br />
<br />
Our key contribution is the novel concept of a CSP pattern and classes of problems defined by forbidden patterns (which can be viewed as forbidding generic sub-problems).  We describe the theoretical framework which can be used to reason about classes of problems defined by forbidden patterns.  We show that this framework generalises certain known hybrid tractable classes.<br />
<br />
Although we are not close to obtaining a complete characterisation concerning the tractability of general forbidden patterns, we prove a dichotomy in a special case: classes of problems that arise when we can only forbid binary negative patterns (generic sub-problems in which only disallowed tuples are specified).  In this case we show that all (finite sets of) forbidden patterns define either polynomial-time solvable or NP-complete classes of instances.<br />

<p>This paper considers the fragment &#8707;&#8704;SO of second-order logic. Many interesting problems, such as conformant planning, can be naturally expressed as finite domain satisfiability problems of this logic. Such satisfiability problems are computationally hard (&#931;P2) and many of these problems are often solved approximately. In this paper, we develop a general approximative method, i.e., a sound but incomplete method, for solving &#8707;&#8704;SO satisfiability problems. We use a syntactic representation of a constraint propagation method for first-order logic to transform such an &#8707;&#8704;SO satisfiability problem to an &#8707;SO(ID) satisfiability problem (second-order logic, extended with inductive definitions). The finite domain satisfiability problem for the latter language is in NP and can be handled by several existing solvers. Inductive definitions are a powerful knowledge representation tool, and this moti- vates us to also approximate &#8707;&#8704;SO(ID) problems. In order to do this, we first show how to perform propagation on such inductive definitions. Next, we use this to approximate &#8707;&#8704;SO(ID) satisfiability problems. All this provides a general theoretical framework for a number of approximative methods in the literature. Moreover, we also show how we can use this framework for solving practical useful problems, such as conformant planning, in an effective way.</p>

<p>Automatic extraction of temporal relations between event pairs is an important task for several natural language processing applications such as Question Answering, Information Extraction, and Summarization. Since most existing methods are supervised and require large corpora, which for many languages do not exist, we have concentrated our efforts to reduce the need for annotated data as much as possible. This paper presents two different algorithms towards this goal. The first algorithm is a weakly supervised machine learning approach for classification of temporal relations between events. In the first stage, the algorithm learns a general classifier from an annotated corpus. Then, inspired by the hypothesis of "one type of temporal relation per discourse'', it extracts useful information from a cluster of topically related documents. We show that by combining the global information of such a cluster with local decisions of a general classifier, a bootstrapping cross-document classifier can be built to extract temporal relations between events. Our experiments show that without any additional annotated data, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is higher than that of several previous successful systems. The second proposed method for temporal relation extraction is based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Within EM, we used different techniques such as a greedy best-first search and integer linear programming for temporal inconsistency removal. We think that the experimental results of our EM based algorithm, as a first step toward a fully unsupervised temporal relation extraction method, is encouraging.</p>

<p>We give the analysis of the computational complexity of coalition structure generation over graphs. Given an undirected graph G = (N,E) and a valuation function v : P(N) &#8594; R over the subsets of nodes, the problem is to find a partition of N into connected subsets, that maximises the sum of the components’ values. This problem is generally NP–complete; in particular, it is hard for a defined class of valuation functions which are independent of disconnected members—that is, two nodes have no effect on each other’s marginal con- tribution to their vertex separator. Nonetheless, for all such functions we provide bounds on the complexity of coalition structure generation over general and minor–free graphs. Our proof is constructive and yields algorithms for solving corresponding instances of the problem. Furthermore, we derive linear time bounds for graphs of bounded treewidth. However, as we show, the problem remains NP–complete for planar graphs, and hence, for any K_k minor–free graphs where k &#8805; 5. Moreover, a 3-SAT problem with m clauses can be represented by a coalition structure generation problem over a planar graph with O(m^2) nodes. Importantly, our hardness result holds for a particular subclass of valuation functions, termed edge sum, where the value of each subset of nodes is simply determined by the sum of given weights of the edges in the induced subgraph.</p>

<p>There is currently a growing interest in techniques for hiding parts of the signature of an ontology Kh that is being reused by another ontology Kv. Towards this goal, in this paper we propose the import-by-query framework, which makes the content of Kh accessible through a limited query interface. If Kv reuses the symbols from Kh in a certain restricted way, one can reason over Kv U Kh by accessing only Kv and the query interface. We map out the landscape of the import-by-query problem. In particular, we outline the limitations of our framework and prove that certain restrictions on the expressivity of Kh and the way in which Kv reuses symbols from Kh are strictly necessary to enable reasoning in our setting. We also identify cases in which reasoning is possible and we present suitable import-by-query reasoning algorithms.<br />

<p>In some domestic professional sports leagues, the home stadiums are located in cities connected by a common train line running in one direction. For these instances, we can incorporate this geographical information to determine optimal or nearly-optimal solutions to the n-team Traveling Tournament Problem (TTP), an NP-hard sports scheduling problem whose solution is a double round-robin tournament schedule that minimizes the sum total of distances traveled by all n teams.<br />
<br />
We introduce the Linear Distance Traveling Tournament Problem (LD-TTP), and solve it for n=4 and n=6, generating the complete set of possible solutions through elementary combinatorial techniques. For larger n, we propose a novel "expander construction" that generates an approximate solution to the LD-TTP. For n congruent to 4 modulo 6, we show that our expander construction produces a feasible double round-robin tournament schedule whose total distance is guaranteed to be no worse than 4/3 times the optimal solution, regardless of where the n teams are located. This 4/3-approximation for the LD-TTP is stronger than the currently best-known ratio of 5/3 + epsilon for the general TTP.<br />
<br />
We conclude the paper by applying this linear distance relaxation to general (non-linear) n-team TTP instances, where we develop fast approximate solutions by simply "assuming" the n teams lie on a straight line and solving the modified problem. We show that this technique surprisingly generates the distance-optimal tournament on all benchmark sets on 6 teams, as well as close-to-optimal schedules for larger n, even when the teams are located around a circle or positioned in three-dimensional space.</p>

<p>This note considers how to modify  BnB-ADOPT, a well-known algorithm for optimally solving distributed constraint optimization problems, with a double aim: (i)   to avoid sending most of the redundant messages and (ii) to handle cost functions of any arity. Some of the messages exchanged by BnB-ADOPT  turned out to be redundant. Removing most of the redundant messages increases substantially communication efficiency: the number of exchanged messages is - in most cases - at least three times fewer (keeping the other measures almost unchanged), and termination and optimality are maintained. On the other hand, handling n-ary cost functions was addressed in the original work, but the presence of thresholds makes their practical usage more complex. Both issues - removing most of the redundant messages and efficiently handling n-ary cost functions - can be combined, producing the new version BnB-ADOPT+. Experimentally, we show the benefits of this  version over the original one. </p>

<p>Dual decomposition, and more generally Lagrangian relaxation, is a classical method for combinatorial optimization; it has recently been applied to several inference problems in natural language processing (NLP). This tutorial gives an overview of the technique. We describe example algorithms, describe formal guarantees for the method, and describe practical issues in implementing the algorithms. While our examples are predominantly drawn from the NLP literature, the material should be of general relevance to inference problems in machine learning. A central theme of this tutorial is that Lagrangian relaxation is naturally applied in conjunction with a broad class of combinatorial algorithms, allowing inference in models that go significantly beyond previous work on Lagrangian relaxation for inference in graphical models.<br />

<p>Relational data representations have become an increasingly important topic due to the recent proliferation of network datasets (e.g., social, biological, information networks) and a corresponding increase in the application of Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) algorithms to these domains. In this article, we examine and categorize techniques for transforming graph-based relational data to improve SRL algorithms. In particular, appropriate transformations of the nodes, links, and/or features of the data can dramatically affect the capabilities and results of SRL algorithms. We introduce an intuitive taxonomy for data representation transformations in relational domains that incorporates link transformation and node transformation as symmetric representation tasks. More specifically, the transformation tasks for both nodes and links include (i) predicting their existence, (ii) predicting their label or type, (iii) estimating their weight or importance, and (iv) system- atically constructing their relevant features. We motivate our taxonomy through detailed examples and use it to survey competing approaches for each of these tasks. We also dis- cuss general conditions for transforming links, nodes, and features. Finally, we highlight challenges that remain to be addressed.</p>

<p>Pseudo-Boolean constraints are omnipresent in practical applications, and thus a significant effort has been devoted to the development of good SAT encoding techniques for them. Some of these encodings first construct a Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) for the constraint, and then encode the BDD into a propositional formula.  These BDD-based approaches have some important advantages, such as not being dependent on the size of the coefficients, or being able to share the same BDD for representing many constraints.<br />
<br />
We first focus on the size of the resulting BDDs, which was considered to be an open problem in our research community. We report on previous work where it was proved that there are Pseudo-Boolean constraints for which no polynomial BDD exists. We also give an alternative and simpler proof assuming that NP is different from Co-NP.  More interestingly, here we also show how to overcome the possible exponential blowup of BDDs by \emph{coefficient decomposition}. This allows us to give the first polynomial generalized arc-consistent ROBDD-based encoding for Pseudo-Boolean constraints.<br />
<br />
Finally, we focus on practical issues: we show how to efficiently construct such ROBDDs, how to encode them into SAT with only 2 clauses per node, and present experimental results that confirm that our approach is competitive with other encodings and state-of-the-art Pseudo-Boolean solvers.<br />

<p>We analyse the computational complexity of three problems in judgment aggregation: (1) computing a collective judgment from a profile of individual judgments (the winner determination problem); (2) deciding whether a given agent can influence the outcome of a judgment aggregation procedure in her favour by reporting insincere judgments (the strategic manipulation problem); and (3) deciding whether a given judgment aggregation scenario is guaranteed to result in a logically consistent outcome, independently from what the judgments supplied by the individuals are (the problem of the safety of the agenda). We provide results both for specific aggregation procedures (the quota rules, the premise-based procedure, and a distance-based procedure) and for classes of aggregation procedures characterised in terms of fundamental axioms.<br />

<p>In this paper, we consider the important problem of safe exploration in reinforcement learning. While reinforcement learning is well-suited to domains with complex transition dynamics and high-dimensional state-action spaces, an additional challenge is posed by the need for safe and efficient exploration. Traditional exploration techniques are not particularly useful for solving dangerous tasks, where the trial and error process may lead to the selection of actions whose execution in some states may result in damage to the learning system (or any other system). Consequently, when an agent begins an interaction with a dangerous and high-dimensional state-action space, an important question arises; namely, that of how to avoid (or at least minimize) damage caused by the exploration of the state-action space. We introduce the PI-SRL algorithm which safely improves suboptimal albeit robust behaviors for continuous state and action control tasks and which efficiently learns from the experience gained from the environment. We evaluate the proposed method in four complex tasks: automatic car parking, pole-balancing, helicopter hovering, and business management.<br />

<p>Replanning via determinization is a recent, popular approach for online planning in MDPs. In this paper we adapt this idea to classical, non-stochastic domains with partial information and sensing actions, presenting a new planner: SDR (Sample, Determinize, Replan). At each step we generate a  solution plan to a classical planning problem induced by the original problem. We execute this plan as long as it is safe to do so. When this is no longer the case, we replan. The classical planning problem we generate is based on the translation-based approach for conformant planning introduced by Palacios and Geffner. The state of the classical planning problem generated in this approach captures the belief state of the agent in the original problem. Unfortunately, when this method is applied to planning problems with sensing, it yields a non-deterministic planning problem that is typically very large. Our main contribution is the introduction of state sampling techniques for overcoming these two problems. In addition, we introduce a novel, lazy, regression-based method for querying the agent's belief state during run-time.  We provide a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the planner, showing that it scales better than the state-of-the-art CLG planner on existing benchmark problems, but also highlighting its weaknesses with new domains.  We also discuss its theoretical guarantees.</p>

<p>The results in this paper add useful tools to the theory of sets of desirable gambles, a growing toolbox for reasoning with partial probability assessments. We investigate how to combine a number of marginal coherent sets of desirable gambles into a joint set using the properties of epistemic irrelevance and independence. We provide formulas for the smallest such joint, called their independent natural extension, and study its main properties. The independent natural extension of maximal coherent sets of desirable gambles allows us to define the strong product of sets of desirable gambles. Finally, we explore an easy way to generalise these results to also apply for the conditional versions of epistemic irrelevance and independence.   Having such a set of tools that are easily implemented in computer programs is clearly beneficial to fields, like AI, with a clear interest in coherent reasoning under uncertainty using general and robust uncertainty models that require no full specification.</p>

<p>Given a current news event, we tackle the problem of generating plausible predictions of future events it might cause.  We present a new methodology for modeling and predicting such future news events using machine learning and data mining techniques. Our Pundit algorithm generalizes examples of causality pairs to infer a causality predictor.  To obtain precisely labeled causality examples, we mine 150 years of news articles and apply semantic natural language modeling techniques to headlines containing certain predefined causality patterns.  For generalization, the model uses a vast number of world knowledge ontologies.  Empirical evaluation on real news articles shows that our Pundit algorithm performs as well as non-expert humans.</p>

<p class="media"><a href="/media/3779/live-3779-6720-jair.pdf">PDF</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/media/3779/live-3779-6718-jair.ps">PostScript</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1613/jair.3779'>doi:10.1613/jair.3779</a></p>
<p>We study the behavior of the A* search algorithm when coupled with a heuristic h satisfying (1-epsilon1)h* <= h <=(1+epsilon2)h*, where 0 <= epsilon1, epsilon2 < 1 are small constants and h* denotes the optimal cost to a solution. We prove a rigorous, general upper bound on the time complexity of A* search on trees that depends on both the accuracy of the heuristic and the distribution of solutions. Our upper bound is essentially tight in the worst case; in fact, we show nearly matching lower bounds that are attained even by non-adversarially chosen solution sets induced by a simple stochastic model. A consequence of our rigorous results is that the effective branching factor of the search will be reduced as long as epsilon1+epsilon2 < 1 and the number of near-optimal solutions in the search tree is not too large. We go on to provide an upper bound for A* search on graphs and in this context establish a bound on running time determined by the spectrum of the graph.<br />
<br />
We then experimentally explore to what extent our rigorous upper bounds predict the behavior of A* in some natural, combinatorially-rich search spaces. We begin by applying A* to solve the knapsack problem with near-accurate admissible heuristics constructed from an efficient approximation algorithm for this problem.  We additionally apply our analysis of A* search for the partial Latin square problem, where we can provide quite exact analytic bounds on the number of near-optimal solutions. These results demonstrate a dramatic reduction in effective branching factor of A* when coupled with near-accurate heuristics in search spaces with suitably sparse solution sets.<br />

<p>Many fundamental problems in artificial intelligence, knowledge representation, and verification involve reasoning about sets and relations between sets and can be modeled as set constraint satisfaction problems (set CSPs). Such problems are frequently intractable, but there are several important set CSPs that are known to be polynomial-time tractable.  We introduce a large class of set CSPs that can be solved in quadratic time.  Our class, which we call EI, contains all previously known tractable set CSPs, but also some new ones that are of crucial importance for example in description logics.  The class of EI set constraints has an elegant universal-algebraic characterization, which we use to show that every set constraint language that properly contains all EI set constraints already has a finite sublanguage with an NP-hard constraint satisfaction problem.<br />

<p>Although, Chinese and Spanish are two of the most spoken languages in the world, not much research has been done in machine translation for this language pair. This paper focuses on investigating the state-of-the-art of Chinese-to-Spanish statistical machine translation (SMT), which nowadays is one of the most popular approaches to machine translation. For this purpose, we report details of the available parallel corpus which are Basic Traveller Expressions Corpus (BTEC), Holy Bible and United Nations (UN). Additionally, we conduct experimental work with the largest of these three corpora to explore alternative SMT strategies by means of using a pivot language. Three alternatives are considered for pivoting: cascading, pseudo-corpus and triangulation. As pivot language, we use either English, Arabic or French. Results show that, for a phrase-based SMT system, English is the best pivot language between Chinese and Spanish. We propose a system output combination using the pivot strategies which is capable of outperforming the direct translation strategy. The main objective of this work is motivating and involving the research community to work in this important pair of languages given their demographic impact.<br />
