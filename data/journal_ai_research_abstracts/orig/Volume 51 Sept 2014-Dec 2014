<p>Diagnosing the execution of a Multiagent Plan (MAP) means identifying and explaining action failures (i.e., actions that did not reach their expected effects). Current approaches to MAP diagnosis are substantially centralized, and assume that action failures are independent of each other.<br />
<br />
In this paper, the diagnosis of  MAPs, executed in a dynamic and partially observable environment, is addressed in a fully distributed and asynchronous  way; in addition, action failures are no longer assumed as independent of each other. <br />
<br />
The paper presents a novel methodology, named Cooperative Weak-Committed Monitoring (CWCM), enabling agents to cooperate while monitoring their own actions. Cooperation helps the agents to cope with very scarcely observable environments: what an agent cannot observe directly can be acquired from other agents. CWCM exploits nondeterministic action models to carry out two main tasks: detecting action failures and building trajectory-sets (i.e., structures representing the knowledge an agent has about the environment in the recent past). Relying on trajectory-sets, each agent is able to explain its own action failures in terms of exogenous events that have occurred during the execution of the actions themselves. To cope with dependent failures, CWCM is coupled with a diagnostic engine that   distinguishes between primary and secondary action failures.<br />
<br />
An experimental analysis demonstrates that the CWCM methodology, together with the proposed diagnostic inferences, are effective in identifying and explaining action failures even in scenarios where the system observability is significantly reduced.</p>

<p>Before deploying a software system we need to assure ourselves (and stakeholders) that the system will behave correctly. This assurance is usually done by testing the system. However, it is intuitively obvious that adaptive systems, including agent-based systems,  can exhibit complex behaviour, and are thus harder to test. In this paper we examine this "obvious intuition" in the case of Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents.  We analyse the size of the behaviour space of BDI agents  and show that although the intuition is correct, the factors that influence the size are not what we expected them to be. Specifically, we found that the introduction of failure handling had a much larger effect on the size of the behaviour space than we expected. We also discuss the implications of these findings on the testability of BDI agents.<br />

<p>Large-scale annotated corpora are a prerequisite to developing high-performance NLP systems. Such corpora are expensive to produce, limited in size, often demanding linguistic expertise. In this paper we use text rewriting as a means of increasing the amount of labeled data available for model training. Our method uses automatically extracted rewrite rules from comparable corpora and bitexts to generate multiple versions of sentences annotated with gold standard labels. We apply this idea to semantic role labeling and show that a model trained on rewritten data outperforms the state of the art on the CoNLL-2009 benchmark dataset.<br />

<p>We consider online planning in Markov decision processes (MDPs). In online planning, the agent focuses on its current state only, deliberates about the set of possible policies from that state onwards and, when interrupted, uses the outcome of that exploratory deliberation to choose what action to perform next. Formally, the performance of algorithms for online planning is assessed in terms of simple regret, the agent's expected performance loss when the chosen action, rather than an optimal one, is followed.<br />
<br />
To date, state-of-the-art algorithms for online planning in general MDPs are either best effort, or guarantee only polynomial-rate reduction of simple regret over time. Here we introduce a new Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm, BRUE, that guarantees exponential-rate and smooth reduction of simple regret.  At a high level, BRUE is based on a simple yet non-standard state-space sampling scheme, MCTS2e, in which different parts of each sample are dedicated to different exploratory objectives. We further extend BRUE with a variant of ``learning by forgetting.'' The resulting parametrized algorithm, BRUE(alpha), exhibits even more attractive formal guarantees than BRUE. Our  empirical evaluation shows that both BRUE and its generalization, BRUE(alpha), are also very effective in practice and  compare favorably to the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p>Simple diffusion processes on networks have been used to model, analyze and predict diverse phenomena such as spread of diseases, information and memes. More often than not, the underlying network data is noisy and sampled. This prompts the following natural question: how sensitive are the diffusion dynamics and subsequent conclusions to uncertainty in the network structure? <br />
<br />
In this paper, we consider two popular diffusion models: Independent cascade (IC) model and Linear threshold (LT) model. We study how the expected number of vertices that are influenced/infected, for particular initial conditions, are affected by network perturbations. Through rigorous analysis under the assumption of a reasonable perturbation model we establish the following main results. (1) For the IC model, we characterize the sensitivity to network perturbation in terms of the critical probability for phase transition of the network. We find that the expected number of infections is quite stable, unless the transmission probability is close to the critical probability. (2) We show that the standard LT model with uniform edge weights is relatively stable under network perturbations. (3) We study these sensitivity questions using extensive simulations on diverse real world networks and find that our theoretical predictions for both models match the observations quite closely. (4) Experimentally, the transient behavior, i.e., the time series of the number of infections, in both models appears to be more sensitive to network perturbations.</p>

<p>The AGM framework is the benchmark approach in belief change. Since the framework assumes an underlying logic containing classical Propositional Logic, it can not be applied to systems with a logic weaker than Propositional Logic.  To remedy this limitation, several researchers have studied AGM-style contraction and revision under the Horn fragment of Propositional Logic (i.e., Horn logic).  In this paper, we contribute to this line of research by investigating the Horn version of the AGM entrenchment-based contraction.  The study is challenging as the construction of entrenchment-based contraction refers to arbitrary disjunctions which are not expressible under Horn logic.  In order to adapt the construction to Horn logic, we make use of a Horn approximation technique called Horn strengthening. We provide a representation theorem for the newly constructed contraction which we refer to as entrenchment-based Horn contraction.  Ideally, contractions defined under Horn logic (i.e., Horn contractions) should be as rational as AGM contraction.  We propose the notion of Horn equivalence which intuitively captures the equivalence between Horn contraction and AGM contraction.  We show that, under this notion, entrenchment-based Horn contraction is equivalent to a restricted form of entrenchment-based contraction.</p>

<p>Macros have long been used in planning to represent subsequences of operators. Macros can be used in place of individual operators during search, sometimes reducing the effort required to find a plan to the goal. Another use of macros is to compactly represent long plans. In this paper we introduce a novel solution concept called automaton plans in which plans are represented using hierarchies of automata. Automaton plans can be viewed as an extension of macros that enables parameterization and branching. We provide several examples that illustrate how automaton plans can be useful, both as a compact representation of exponentially long plans and as an alternative to sequential solutions in benchmark domains such as Logistics and Grid. We also compare automaton plans to other compact plan representations from the literature, and find that automaton plans are strictly more expressive than macros, but strictly less expressive than HTNs and certain representations allowing efficient sequential access to the operators of the plan.</p>

<p>This paper deals with the problem of classical planning for multiple cooperative agents who have private information about their local state and capabilities they do not want to reveal. Two main approaches have recently been proposed to solve this type of problem -- one is based on reduction to distributed constraint satisfaction, and the other on partial-order planning techniques. In classical single-agent planning, constraint-based and partial-order planning techniques are currently dominated by heuristic forward search. The question arises whether it is possible to formulate a distributed heuristic forward search algorithm for privacy-preserving classical multi-agent planning. Our work provides a positive answer to this question in the form of a general approach to distributed state-space search in which each agent performs only the part of the state expansion relevant to it. The resulting algorithms are simple and efficient -- outperforming previous algorithms by orders of magnitude -- while offering similar flexibility to that of forward-search algorithms for single-agent planning. Furthermore, one particular variant of our general approach yields a distributed version of the A* algorithm that is the first cost-optimal distributed algorithm for privacy-preserving planning.</p>

<p>Artifact systems are a novel paradigm for specifying and implementing business processes described in terms of interacting modules called artifacts. Artifacts consist of data and lifecycles, accounting respectively for the relational structure of the artifacts’ states and their possible evolutions over time. In this paper we put forward artifact-centric multi-agent systems, a novel formalisation of artifact systems in the context of multi-agent systems operating on them. Differently from the usual process-based models of services, we give a semantics that explicitly accounts for the data structures on which artifact systems are defined.<br />
<br />
We study the model checking problem for artifact-centric multi-agent systems against specifications expressed in a quantified version of temporal-epistemic logic expressing the knowledge of the agents in the exchange. We begin by noting that the problem is undecidable in general. We identify a noteworthy class of systems that admit bisimilar, finite abstractions. It follows that we can verify these systems by investigating their finite abstractions; we also show that the corresponding model checking problem is EXPSPACE-complete. We then introduce artifact-centric programs, compact and declarative representations of the programs governing both the artifact system and the agents. We show that, while these in principle generate infinite-state systems, under natural conditions their verification problem can be solved on finite abstractions that can be effectively computed from the programs. We exemplify the theoretical results here pursued through a mainstream procurement scenario from the artifact systems literature.<br />

<p>This paper introduces a novel encoding of Model Based Diagnosis (MBD) to Boolean Satisfaction (SAT) focusing on minimal cardinality diagnosis. The encoding is based on a combination of sophisticated MBD preprocessing algorithms and the application of a SAT compiler which optimizes the encoding to provide more succinct CNF representations than obtained with previous works. Experimental evidence indicates that our approach is superior to all published algorithms for minimal cardinality MBD. In particular, we can determine, for the first time, minimal cardinality diagnoses for the entire standard ISCAS-85 and 74XXX benchmarks. Our results open the way to improve the state-of-the-art on a range of similar MBD problems.</p>

<p>It is widely acknowledged that stochastic local search (SLS) algorithms can efficiently find models for satisfiable instances of the satisfiability (SAT) problem, especially for random k-SAT instances. However, compared to random 3-SAT instances where SLS algorithms have shown great success, random k-SAT instances with long clauses remain very difficult. Recently, the notion of second level score, denoted as "score_2", was proposed for improving SLS algorithms on long-clause SAT instances, and was first used in the powerful CCASat solver as a tie breaker.<br />
<br />
In this paper, we propose three new scoring functions based on score_2. Despite their simplicity, these functions are very effective for solving random k-SAT with long clauses. The first function combines score and score_2, and the second one additionally integrates the diversification property "age". These two functions are used in developing a new SLS algorithm called CScoreSAT. Experimental results on large random 5-SAT and 7-SAT instances near phase transition show that CScoreSAT significantly outperforms previous SLS solvers. However, CScoreSAT cannot rival its competitors on random k-SAT instances at phase transition. We improve CScoreSAT for such instances by another scoring function which combines score_2 with age. The resulting algorithm HScoreSAT exhibits state-of-the-art performance on random k-SAT (k>3) instances at phase transition. We also study the computation of score_2, including its implementation and computational complexity.<br />

<p>Multi-agent Pathfinding is a relevant problem in a wide range of domains, for example in robotics and video games research. Formally, the problem considers a graph consisting of vertices and edges, and a set of agents occupying vertices. An agent can only move to an unoccupied, neighbouring vertex, and the problem of finding the minimal sequence of moves to transfer each agent from its start location to its destination is an NP-hard problem.<br />
<br />
We present Push and Rotate, a new algorithm that is complete for Multi-agent Pathfinding problems in which there are at least two empty vertices. Push and Rotate first divides the graph into subgraphs within which it is possible for agents to reach any position of the subgraph, and then uses the simple push, swap, and rotate operations to find a solution; a post-processing algorithm is also presented that eliminates redundant moves. Push and Rotate can be seen as extending Luna and Bekris's Push and Swap algorithm, which we showed to be incomplete in a previous publication.<br />

In our experiments we compare our approach with the Push and Swap, MAPP, and Bibox algorithms. The latter algorithm is restricted to a smaller class of instances as it requires biconnected graphs, but can nevertheless be considered state of the art due to its strong performance. Our experiments show that Push and Swap suffers from incompleteness, MAPP is generally not competitive with Push and Rotate, and Bibox is better than Push and Rotate on randomly generated biconnected instances, while Push and Rotate performs better on grids.</p>

<p>Increasing the expressiveness of qualitative spatial calculi is an essential step towards meeting the requirements of applications. This can be achieved by combining existing calculi in a way that we can express spatial information using relations from multiple calculi. The great challenge is to develop reasoning algorithms that are correct and complete when reasoning over the combined information. Previous work has mainly studied cases where the interaction between the combined calculi was small, or where one of the two calculi was very simple. In this paper we tackle the important combination of topological and directional information for extended spatial objects. We combine some of the best known calculi in qualitative spatial reasoning, the RCC8 algebra for representing topological information, and the Rectangle Algebra (RA) and the Cardinal Direction Calculus (CDC) for directional information. We consider two different interpretations of the RCC8 algebra, one uses a weak connectedness relation, the other uses a strong connectedness relation. In both interpretations, we show that reasoning with topological and directional information is decidable and remains in NP. Our computational complexity results unveil the significant differences between RA and CDC, and that between weak and strong RCC8 models. Take the combination of basic RCC8 and basic CDC constraints as an example: we show that the consistency problem is in P only when we use the strong RCC8 algebra and explicitly know the corresponding basic RA constraints.<br />

<p class="media"><a href="/media/4360/live-4360-8271-jair.pdf">PDF</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/media/4360/live-4360-8270-jair.ps">PostScript</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1613/jair.4360'>doi:10.1613/jair.4360</a></p>
<p>A contract algorithm is an algorithm which is given, as part of the input, a specified amount of allowable computation time. The algorithm must then complete its execution within the allotted time. An interruptible algorithm, in contrast, can be interrupted at an arbitrary point in time, at which point it must report its currently best solution. It is known that contract algorithms can simulate interruptible algorithms using  iterative deepening techniques. This simulation is done at a penalty  in the performance of the solution, as measured by the so-called acceleration ratio.<br />
<br />
In this paper we give matching (i.e., optimal)  upper and lower bounds for the acceleration ratio under such a simulation. We assume the most general setting in which n problem instances must be solved by means of scheduling executions of contract algorithms in $m$ identical parallel processors. This resolves an open conjecture of Bernstein, Filkenstein, and Zilberstein who gave an optimal schedule under the restricted setting of round robin and length-increasing schedules, but whose optimality in the general unrestricted case remained open.<br />
<br />
Lastly, we show how to evaluate the average acceleration ratio of the class of exponential strategies in the setting of n problem instances and m parallel processors. This is a broad class of schedules that tend to be either optimal or near-optimal, for several variants of the basic problem.</p>

<p>The Workflow Satisfiability Problem (WSP) is a problem of practical interest that arises whenever tasks need to be performed by authorized users, subject to constraints defined by business rules.  We are required to decide whether there exists a plan - an assignment of tasks to authorized users - such that all constraints are satisfied.  It is natural to see the WSP as a subclass of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) in which the variables are tasks and the domain is the set of users.  What makes the WSP distinctive is that the number of tasks is usually very small compared to the number of users, so it is appropriate to ask for which constraint languages the WSP is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), parameterized by the number of tasks.<br />
<br />
This novel approach to the WSP, using techniques from CSP, has enabled us to  design a generic algorithm which is FPT for several families of workflow constraints considered in the literature. Furthermore, we prove that the union of FPT languages remains FPT if they satisfy a simple compatibility condition.  Lastly, we identify a new FPT constraint language, user-independent constraints, that includes many of the constraints of interest in business processing systems.   We demonstrate that our generic algorithm has provably optimal running time O*(2^(klog k)), for this language, where k is the number of tasks.</p>

<p>Recently fair division theory has emerged as a promising approach for allocation of multiple computational resources among agents. While in reality agents are not all present in the system simultaneously, previous work has studied static settings where all relevant information is known upfront. Our goal is to better understand the dynamic setting. On the conceptual level, we develop a dynamic model of fair division, and propose desirable axiomatic properties for dynamic resource allocation mechanisms. On the technical level, we construct two novel mechanisms that provably satisfy some of these properties, and analyze their performance using real data. We believe that our work informs the design of superior multiagent systems, and at the same time expands the scope of fair division theory by initiating the study of dynamic and fair resource allocation mechanisms.</p>

<p>Knowledge Discovery in Databases is a complex process that involves many different data processing and learning operators. Today's Knowledge Discovery Support Systems can contain several hundred operators.  A major challenge is to assist the user in designing workflows which are not only valid but also -- ideally -- optimize some performance measure associated with the user goal.  In this paper we present such a system. The system relies on a meta-mining module which analyses past data mining experiments and extracts meta-mining models which associate dataset characteristics with workflow descriptors in view of workflow performance optimization. The meta-mining model is used within a data mining workflow planner, to guide the planner during the workflow planning. We learn the meta-mining models  using a similarity learning approach, and extract the workflow descriptors by mining the workflows for generalized relational patterns accounting also for domain knowledge provided by a data mining ontology.  We evaluate the quality of the data mining workflows that the system produces on a collection of real world datasets coming from biology and show that it produces workflows that are significantly better than alternative methods that can only do workflow selection and not planning.</p>

<p>OWL 2 EL is a popular ontology language that supports role inclusions---that is, axioms that capture compositional properties of roles. Role inclusions closely correspond to context-free grammars, which was used to show that answering conjunctive queries (CQs) over OWL 2 EL knowledge bases with unrestricted role inclusions is undecidable. However, OWL 2 EL inherits from OWL 2 DL the syntactic regularity restriction on role inclusions, which ensures that role chains implying a particular role can be described using a finite automaton (FA). This is sufficient to ensure decidability of CQ answering; however, the FAs can be worst-case exponential in size so the known approaches do not provide a tight upper complexity bound.<br />
<br />
In this paper, we solve this open problem and show that answering CQs over OWL 2 EL knowledge bases is PSPACE-complete in combined complexity (i.e., the complexity measured in the total size of the input). To this end, we use a novel encoding of regular role inclusions using bounded-stack pushdown automata---that is, FAs extended with a stack of bounded size. Apart from theoretical interest, our encoding can be used in practical tableau algorithms to avoid the exponential blowup due to role inclusions. In addition, we sharpen the lower complexity bound and show that the problem is PSPACE-hard even if we consider only role inclusions as part of the input (i.e., the query and all other parts of the knowledge base are fixed). Finally, we turn our attention to navigational queries over OWL 2 EL knowledge bases, and we show that answering positive, converse-free conjunctive graph XPath queries is PSPACE-complete as well; this is interesting since allowing the converse operator in queries is known to make the problem EXPTIME-hard. Thus, in this paper we present several important contributions to the landscape of the complexity of answering expressive queries over description logic knowledge bases.</p>

<p>A Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF) is called matched if the system of sets of variables which appear in individual clauses has a system of distinct representatives. Each matched CNF is trivially satisfiable (each clause can be satisfied by its representative variable). Another property which is easy to see, is that the class of matched CNFs is not closed under partial assignment of truth values to variables. This latter property leads to a fact (proved here) that given two matched CNFs it is co-NP complete to decide whether they are logically equivalent. The construction in this proof leads to another result: a much shorter and simpler proof of the fact that the Boolean minimization problem for matched CNFs is a complete problem for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. The main result of this paper deals with the structure of clause minimum CNFs. We prove here that if a Boolean function f admits a representation by a matched CNF then every clause minimum CNF representation of f is matched. <br />

<p>A continuous-time Markov process (CTMP) is a collection of variables indexed by a continuous quantity, time. It obeys the Markov property that the distribution over a future variable is independent of past variables given the state at the present time. We introduce continuous-time Markov process representations and algorithms for filtering, smoothing, expected sufficient statistics calculations, and model estimation, assuming no prior knowledge of continuous-time processes but some basic knowledge of probability and statistics. We begin by describing "flat" or unstructured Markov processes and then move to structured Markov processes (those arising from state spaces consisting of assignments to variables) including Kronecker, decision-diagram, and continuous-time Bayesian network representations. We provide the first connection between decision-diagrams and continuous-time Bayesian networks.<br />

<p>Symbolic search using binary decision diagrams (BDDs) can often save large amounts of memory due to its concise representation of state sets. A decisive factor for this method's success is the chosen variable ordering. Generally speaking, it is plausible that dependent variables should be brought close together in order to reduce BDD sizes. In planning, variable dependencies are typically captured by means of causal graphs, and in preceding work these were taken as the basis for finding BDD variable orderings. Starting from the observation that the two concepts of "dependency" are actually quite different, we introduce a framework for assessing the strength of variable ordering heuristics in sub-classes of planning. It turns out that, even for extremely simple planning tasks, causal graph based variable orders may be exponentially worse than optimal.<br />
<br />
Experimental results on a wide range of variable ordering variants corroborate our theoretical findings. Furthermore, we show that dynamic reordering is much more effective at reducing BDD size, but it is not cost-effective due to a prohibitive runtime overhead. We exhibit the potential of middle-ground techniques, running dynamic reordering until simple stopping criteria hold.<br />

<p>In recent years, the field of computational sustainability has striven to apply artificial intelligence techniques to solve ecological and environmental problems. In ecology, a key issue for the safeguarding of our planet is the monitoring of biodiversity. Automated acoustic recognition of species aims to provide a cost-effective method for biodiversity monitoring. This is particularly appealing for detecting endangered animals with a distinctive call, such as the New Forest cicada. To this end, we pursue a crowdsourcing approach, whereby the millions of visitors to the New Forest, where this insect was historically found, will help to monitor its presence by means of a smartphone app that can detect its mating call. Existing research in the field of acoustic insect detection has typically focused upon the classification of recordings collected from fixed field microphones. Such approaches segment a lengthy audio recording into individual segments of insect activity, which are independently classified using cepstral coefficients extracted from the recording as features. This paper reports on a contrasting approach, whereby we use crowdsourcing to collect recordings via a smartphone app, and present an immediate feedback to the users as to whether an insect has been found. Our classification approach does not remove silent parts of the recording via segmentation, but instead uses the temporal patterns throughout each recording to classify the insects present. We show that our approach can successfully discriminate between the call of the New Forest cicada and similar insects found in the New Forest, and is robust to common types of environment noise. A large scale trial deployment of our smartphone app collected over 6000 reports of insect activity from over 1000 users. Despite the cicada not having been rediscovered in the New Forest, the effectiveness of this approach was confirmed for both the detection algorithm, which successfully identified the same cicada through the app in countries where the same species is still present, and of the crowdsourcing methodology, which collected a vast number of recordings and involved thousands of contributors.</p>

<p>Developing scalable solution algorithms is one of the central problems in computational game theory. We present an iterative algorithm for computing an exact Nash equilibrium for two-player zero-sum extensive-form games with imperfect information. Our approach combines two key elements: (1) the compact sequence-form representation of extensive-form games and (2) the algorithmic framework of double-oracle methods. The main idea of our algorithm is to restrict the game by allowing the players to play only selected sequences of available actions. After solving the restricted game, new sequences are added by finding best responses to the current solution using fast algorithms. <br />
<br />
We experimentally evaluate our algorithm on a set of games inspired by patrolling scenarios, board, and card games. The results show significant runtime improvements in games admitting an equilibrium with small support, and substantial improvement in memory use even on games with large support. The improvement in memory use is particularly important because it allows our algorithm to solve much larger game instances than existing linear programming methods. <br />

Our main contributions include (1) a generic sequence-form double-oracle algorithm for solving zero-sum extensive-form games; (2) fast methods for maintaining a valid restricted game model when adding new sequences; (3) a search algorithm and pruning methods for computing best-response sequences; (4) theoretical guarantees about the convergence of the algorithm to a Nash equilibrium; (5) experimental analysis of our algorithm on several games, including an approximate version of the algorithm.</p>
