m  p wellman 1993 a marketoriented programming environment and its application to distributed multicommodity flow problems volume 1 pages 123

market price systems constitute a well understood class of mechanisms that under certain conditions provide effective decentralization of decision making with minimal communication overhead  in a market oriented programming approach to distributed problem solving  we derive the activities and resource allocations for a set of computational agents by computing the competitive equilibrium of an artificial economy  walras provides basic constructs for defining computational market structures  and protocols for deriving their corresponding price equilibria  in a particular realization of this approach for a form of multicommodity flow problem  we see that careful construction of the decision process according to economic principles can lead to efficient distributed resource allocation  and that the behavior of the system can be meaningfully analyzed in economic terms
