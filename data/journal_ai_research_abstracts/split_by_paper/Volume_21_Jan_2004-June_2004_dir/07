information about user preferences plays a key role in automated decision making in many domains it is desirable to assess such preferences in a qualitative rather than quantitative way in this paper we propose a qualitative graphical representation of preferences that reflects conditional dependence and independence of preference statements under a ceteris paribus all else being equal interpretation such a representation is often compact and arguably quite natural in many circumstances we provide a formal semantics for this model and describe how the structure of the network can be exploited in several inference tasks such as determining whether one outcome dominates is preferred to another ordering a set outcomes according to the preference relation and constructing the best outcome subject to available evidence
