s  acid and l  m de campos 2003 searching for bayesian network structures in the space of restricted acyclic partially directed graphs volume 18 pages 445490

although many algorithms have been designed to construct    bayesian network structures using different approaches and principles    they all employ only two methods those based on independence    criteria and those based on a scoring function and a search procedure    although some methods combine the two within the scoresearch    paradigm the dominant approach uses local search methods in the space    of directed acyclic graphs dags where the usual choices for    defining the elementary modifications local changes that can be    applied are arc addition arc deletion and arc reversal in this    paper we propose a new local search method that uses a different    search space and which takes account of the concept of equivalence    between network structures restricted acyclic partially directed    graphs rpdags in this way the number of different configurations    of the search space is reduced thus improving efficiency moreover    although the final result must necessarily be a local optimum given    the nature of the search method the topology of the new search space    which avoids making early decisions about the directions of the arcs    may help to find better local optima than those obtained by searching    in the dag space detailed results of the evaluation of the proposed    search method on several test problems including the wellknown alarm    monitoring system are also presented
