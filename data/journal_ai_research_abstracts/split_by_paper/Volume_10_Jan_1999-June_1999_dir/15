d  barber and p  de van laar 1999 variational cumulant expansions for intractable distributions volume 10 pages 435455

intractable distributions present a common difficulty in    inference within the probabilistic knowledge representation framework    and variational methods have recently been popular in providing an    approximate solution in this article we describe a perturbational    approach in the form of a cumulant expansion which to lowest order    recovers the standard kullbackleibler variational bound    higherorder terms describe corrections on the variational approach    without incurring much further computational cost  the relationship    to other perturbational approaches such as tap is also elucidated  we    demonstrate the method on a particular class of undirected graphical    models boltzmann machines for which our simulation results confirm    improved accuracy and enhanced stability during learning
