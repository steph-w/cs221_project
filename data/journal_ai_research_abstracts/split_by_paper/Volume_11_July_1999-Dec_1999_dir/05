the notion of class is ubiquitous in computer science and is    central in many formalisms for the representation of structured    knowledge used both in knowledge representation and in databases  in    this paper we study the basic issues underlying such representation    formalisms and single out both their common characteristics and their    distinguishing features  such investigation leads us to propose a    unifying framework in which we are able to capture the fundamental    aspects of several representation languages used in different    contexts  the proposed formalism is expressed in the style of    description logics which have been introduced in knowledge    representation as a means to provide a semantically wellfounded basis    for the structural aspects of knowledge representation systems the    description logic considered in this paper is a subset of first order    logic with nice computational characteristics  it is quite expressive    and features a novel combination of constructs that has not been    studied before  the distinguishing constructs are number    restrictions which generalize existence and functional dependencies    inverse roles which allow one to refer to the inverse of a    relationship and possibly cyclic assertions which are necessary for    capturing real world domains  we are able to show that it is    precisely such combination of constructs that makes our logic powerful    enough to model the essential set of features for defining class    structures that are common to frame systems objectoriented database    languages and semantic data models  as a consequence of the    established correspondences several significant extensions of each of    the above formalisms become available the high expressiveness of the    logic we propose and the need for capturing the reasoning in different    contexts forces us to distinguish between unrestricted and finite    model reasoning  a notable feature of our proposal is that reasoning    in both cases is decidable  we argue that by virtue of the high    expressive power and of the associated reasoning capabilities on both    unrestricted and finite models our logic provides a common core for    classbased representation formalisms
