y  gao and  j  culberson 2002 an analysis of phase transition in nk landscapes volume 17 pages 309332

in this paper we analyze the decision version of the nk    landscape model from the perspective of threshold phenomena and phase    transitions under two random distributions the uniform probability    model and the fixed ratio model for the uniform probability model we    prove that the phase transition is easy in the sense that there is a    polynomial algorithm that can solve a random instance of the problem    with the probability asymptotic to 1 as the problem size tends to    infinity for the fixed ratio model we establish several upper bounds    for the solubility threshold and prove that random instances with    parameters above these upper bounds can be solved polynomially this    together with our empirical study for random instances generated below    and in the phase transition region suggests that the phase transition    of the fixed ratio model is also easy
