r  barzilay and  n  elhadad 2002 inferring strategies for sentence ordering in multidocument news summarization volume 17 pages 3555

the problem of organizing information for multidocument    summarization so that the generated summary is coherent has received    relatively little attention  while sentence ordering for single    document summarization can be determined from the ordering of    sentences in the input article this is not the case for multidocument    summarization where summary sentences may be drawn from different    input articles in this paper we propose a methodology for studying    the properties of ordering information in the news genre and describe    experiments done on a corpus of multiple acceptable orderings we    developed for the task based on these experiments we implemented a    strategy for ordering information that combines constraints from    chronological order of events and topical relatedness  evaluation of    our augmented algorithm shows a significant improvement of the    ordering over two baseline strategies
